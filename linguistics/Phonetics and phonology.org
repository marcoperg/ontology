#+title: Phonetics and Phonology

* Phonetics and Phonology
Phonetics and phonology are two disciples that study speech sounds from different perspectvies.

** Phonetics
Studies sounds as phisical events, how they are produced, transmitted and perceived.


** Phonology
Studies how sounds function in a language. This discipline tries to decide between:

*** Phonemes (contrastive)
Which are linguistically relevant sounds and constitute the smallest unit in a language that can cause a difference in meaning between two words.

*** Allophones (not constrastive)
Cannot change the meaning of a word.

For example, /ɾ/ and /t/ are phonemes in spanish (pata vs para, i.e. ['pata] vs ['paɾa]) but allophones in english (city).
