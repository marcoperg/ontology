#+title: Transfinite Induction

Transfinite induction, like regular induction, is used to show a property \(P(n)\) holds for all numbers \(n\).

The \(A\) be a well ordered set and let \(P(x)\) be a proposition with domain \(A\). A proof by transfinite induction uses the following steps: 1. Show \(P(0)\) is true. 2. Assume \(P(b)\) for all \(b < a\). 3. Show \(P(a)\), using assumption in (2). 4. Then \(P(a)\) is true for all \(a \in A\).

The first transfinite induction methods were develop by Cantor to prove various results in point-set topology. Zermelo (1904) extended Cantor's original method with a "proof that every set can be well-ordered", which became [[id:E4068E5E-6D76-4C89-B4EC-22E84E23478F][Zorn's Lemma]]. Transfinite induction and Zorn's lemma are often used interchangeably, or are strongly linked.
