#+title: Green's Theorem in Plane

Let \(P(x, y)\) and \(Q(x, y)\) be continuous and have continuous partial derivatives in a region \(\mathcal{R}\) and on its boundary \(C\). /Green's Theorem/ states that
\[
\oint_C P\,dx + Q\,dy = \iint_\mathcal{R} \left(\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial P}{\partial y}\right)\,dx\,dy
\]
The theorem is valid both [[id:886F9E7C-95BA-437B-977F-637686061F7E][simply and multiply connected regions]].
