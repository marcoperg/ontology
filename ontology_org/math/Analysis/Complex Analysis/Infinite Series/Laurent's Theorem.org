aliases: - Laurent's series

Let \(C_1\) and \(C_2\) be concentric circles of radii \(R_1\), and \(R_2\), respectively, and center at \(a\). Suppose that \(f(z)\) is single-valued and [[id:3C67CDAF-C6A1-459F-8733-49487370C514][analytic]] inside the annulus formed between \(C_1\) and \(C_2\) and in its boundary.

Then we can write
\[
f(z) = f_0(z) + f_1(z)
\]
where \(f_0\) is analytic for \(|z - a| <R_1\)$ (that is, inside the circle delimited by \(C_1\)) and \(f_1\) is analytic for \(|z - a| > R_2\) (that is, outside the circle delimited by \(C_2\)).

The decomposition can be made explicit on terms of \(f(z)\) as follows
\[
f(z) = \frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint_{C_1}\frac{f(w)}{w-z}\,dw - \frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint_{C_2}\frac{f(w)}{w-z}\,dw
\]

Using the [[id:5C6634ED-0C6A-41BE-AEC7-86E744E8C5BB][Taylor's expansion]] of each term we can write the decomposition in terms of an infinite series.

\[
f(z) = \sum_{n\in \mathbb{Z}} a_n (z - a)^n
\]
where we can show \(a_n\) to be
\[
a_n = \frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint_C \frac{f(z)}{(z - a)^{n+1}}\,dz
\]
for any concentric circle \(C\) between \(C_1\) and \(C_2\).

Hence, we can write \(f(z)\) as
\[
f(z) = a_0 + a_1(z-a) + a_2 (z-a)^2 + \dots+\frac{a_{-1}}{z-a}+\frac{a_{-2}}{(z-a)^2}+\dots
\]
in this representation, we call the part \(a_0+a_1(z-a)+a_2(z-a)^2 + \dots\) is called the /analytic part/ of the Laurent Series, and the remainder of the series, containing of inverse powers of \(z-a\), is called the /principal part/.
