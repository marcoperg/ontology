#+title: Taylor's theorem

aliases: - Taylor's series - Taylor's expansion

Let \(f(z)\) be [[id:3C67CDAF-C6A1-459F-8733-49487370C514][analytic]] inside and on a simple closed curve \(C\). Let \(a\) and \(a+h\) be two points inside \(C\). Then
\[
f(a+h) = f(a) + hf'(a) + \frac{h^2}{2!}f''(a)+\dots+\frac{h^n}{n!}f^{(n)}(a)+\dots
\]
or writing \(z =a+h\), \(h= z-a\),
\[
f(z) = f(a) + f'(a)(z-a) + \frac{f''(a)}{2!}(z-a)^2+\dots + \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(z-a)^n+\dots
\]
This is called /Taylor's theorem/ and the two [[id:2A850792-1DC3-44DF-B00A-A809613B34C0][series]] is called a /Taylor series/ for \(f(a+h)\) or \(f(z)\).

The region of converges of the series is given by \(|z-a| < R\), where the radius of convergence \(R\) is the distance from \(a\) to the nearest singularity of the functions \(f(z)\). On \(|z-a| = R\), the series may or may not converge. For \(|z-a| > R\), the series diverges.
