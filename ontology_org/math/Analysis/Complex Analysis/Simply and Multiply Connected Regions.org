#+title: Simply and Multiply Connected Regions

--------------

aliases: - simply-connected - multiply-connected
---

A region \(\mathcal{R}\) is called /simply connected/ if any simple closed curve, which lies in \(\mathcal{R}\), can be shrunk to a point without leaving \(\mathcal{R}\). A region \(\mathcal{R}\), which is not simply connected is called /multiply-connected/.

Intuitively, a simply-connected region is one that does not have any "holes" in it, while a multiply-connected region is one that does.

Pending more rigorous definition.
