#+title: Natural transformation

aliases: - natural transformations - natural transformation

If \(F\) and \(G\) are [[id:04CF5E7D-FCF2-468E-A245-CD0A863FA1F7][functors]] between the [[id:6B755D9E-EB8E-4673-ADD0-B4411D410D52][categories]] \(C\) and \(D\), then a *natural transformation* \(\eta\) from \(F\) to \(G\) is a family of morphisms satisfying two requirements: 1. The natural transformation must associate, to every object \(X\) in \(C\), a morphism \(\eta_X: F(X) \to G(X)\) between objects of \(D\). The morphism \(\eta_X\) is called the *component* of \(\eta\) at \(X\). 2. Components must be such that for every morphism \(f: X\to Y\) in \(C\) the following diagram commutes

\begin{document}
\begin{tikzcd} 
    X\arrow[d, "f"] & F(X) \arrow[r, "\eta_X"] \arrow[d, "F(f)"] & G(X) \arrow[d, "G(f)"] \\
    Y & F(Y) \arrow[r, "\eta_Y"] & G(Y)
\end{tikzcd} 
\end{document}

2) [@2] is called the *naturality condition*.

** Example
In \(\text{Vect}\) we define the following morphism between a vector space \(V\) and its double dual \(V^{**}\):
\[\mathcal{E}_V: V\to V^{**}: v\mapsto \left(f\in V^*\mapsto f(v)\right)\]
Then, the family \(\left(\mathcal{E}_V\right)_{V\in \text{Vect}}\) defines a natural transformation \(\mathcal{E}: \mathbb{1}_\text{Vect}\to (\cdot)^{**}\).
In this case, the naturality condition comes down to

#+begin_src tikz
\usepackage{tikz-cd}
\begin{document}
\begin{tikzcd} 
    V\arrow[d, "l"] & V \arrow[r, "\mathcal{E}_V"] \arrow[d, "l"] & V^{**} \arrow[d, "F\in V^{**} \mapsto (g\in W^* \mapsto F(g\circ l))"] \\
    W & W \arrow[r, "\mathcal{E}_W"] & W^{**}
\end{tikzcd} 
\end{document}
