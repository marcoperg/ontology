#+title: Stabilizer code

** Definition
Let us define an \([n,k]\) stabilizer quantum error-correcting code to encode \(k\) logical qubits into \(n\) physical qubits.

The rate of such a code is \(k/n\). Its stabilizer \(S\) is an [[id:48FAF6F8-DD4A-49F5-89B1-DCE13AE4A2F7][abelian subgroup]] of the \(n\)-fold [[id:C97AB4A8-8038-461C-9BA5-D4149E0C5021][Pauli Group]] \(\Pi^n\). \(S\) does not contain the operator \(-I^{\otimes n}\). The simultaneous \(+1\)-eigenspace of the operators constitutes the /codespace/. The codespace has dimension \(2^k\) so that we can encode \(k\) quibits into it. The stabilizer \(S\) has a minimal representation in terms of \(n-k\) independent generators.

\[
\{g_1, ..., g_{n-k} | \forall i\in \{1, ..., n-k\}, g_i \in S\}
\]
