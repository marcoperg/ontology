aliases: - model - structure

A structure consists of a set along with a collection of finitary operations and relation that are defined on it.

** Definition
Formally, a *structure* can be defined as a triplet \(\mathcal{A} = (A, \sigma, I)\) consisting of - a domain \(A\), which is an arbitrary set. - a signature \(\sigma = (S, \text{ar})\), which is in addition, formed by a set \(S\) of function symbols and relation symbols along with a function \(\text{ar}: S \to \mathbb{N}_0\) that ascribes to each symbol \(s\) a natural number. - an interpretation function \(I\) that assigns functions and relations to the symbols of the signature.

** In model theory
For a given theory in model theory, a structure is called a *model* if it satisfies the defining axioms of that theory.
