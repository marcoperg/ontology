#+title: Derivations and refutations

** Derivation
A /derivation/ of \(C_m\) from \(\{C_1, \dots C_n\}\) is a sequence \(\langle C_1, \dots, C_n, C_{n+1}, \dots, C_m\rangle\) such that - every \(C_i\) comes from a deduction step between two clauses which appear before in the sequence - no deduction step is done more than once

** Refutation
A /refutation/ of \(\{C_1, \dots C_n\}\) is a derivation of \(\Box\) from \(\{C_1, \dots C_n\}\).

​**here deduction step is in the sense of applying an inference rule (e.g. [[id:3E5E5349-BEEE-4F11-86F7-E1E2D53B0C4F][MGU resolution]]) to some clauses.

** Types of derivations
*** Linear derivations
A linear derivation of \(C_m\) from \(\{C_1, \dots C_n\}\) is a sequence \(\langle C_1, \dots, C_n, C_{n+1}, \dots, C_m\rangle\) such that - \(C_{n+1}\) comes from a deduction step between two clauses of \(\{C_1, \dots, C_n\}\) (header clauses). - for every \(i > n+1\), \(C_i\) comes from a deduction step between \(C_{i-1}\) and another clause \(C_j\), with \(j < i -1\).

*** Input derivations
A input derivation of \(C_m\) from \(\{C_1, \dots C_n\}\) is a sequence \(\langle C_1, \dots, C_n, C_{n+1}, \dots, C_m\rangle\) such that for every \(i > n\), the clause \(C_i\) comes from a deduction step between \(C_k \in \{C_1, \dots, C_n\}\) and another \(C_j\) (\(j < i)\).

*** Directed derivations
A linear derivation of \(C_m\) from \(\{C_1, \dots C_n\}\), with support set \(S \subset \mathcal{C}\), is a sequence \(\langle C_1, \dots, C_n, C_{n+1}, \dots, C_m\rangle\) such that - for every \(i > n\), \(C_i\) comes from a deduction step between two previous clauses in the sequence, such that at least one of them does not belong to \(S\). - clauses in \(S\) are /support clauses/, while clauses in \(\mathcal{C}\backslash S\) are /goal clauses/.

*** Ordered derivations
A input derivation of \(C_m\) from \(\{C_1, \dots C_n\}\) is a sequence \(\langle C_1, \dots, C_n, C_{n+1}, \dots, C_m\rangle\) such that - for every \(i > n\), \(C_i\) is the resolvent of two previous clauses
\[
A_1 \lor L_{11} \lor \dots \lor L_{1p} \quad\text{and}\quad \lnot A_2 \lor L_{21} \lor \dots \lor L_{2q}
\]
where \(A_1\) and \(A_2\) are [[id:88A11C01-9297-431F-9E0D-B156077139E9][unifiable]] with MGU \(\sigma\) and order matters - the literals \(C_i\) are ordered as
\[
(L_{11}\lor\dots\lor L_{1p}\lor L_{21}\lor\dots\lor L_{2q})\sigma
\]
