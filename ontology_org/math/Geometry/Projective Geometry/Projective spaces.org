*Definition:* Given a vector space \(E\) over a field \(K\) to be arbitrary the /projective space/ \(\mathbf{P}(E)\) /induced by/ \(E\) is the set \((E - \{0\})/ \sim\) of equivalence classes of nonzero vectors in \(E\) under the equivalence relation \(\sim\) defined such that for all \(u, v \in E - \{0\}\),

$$
u \sim v \quad\textrm{iff}\quad v = \lambda u, \quad \forall \lambda \in K - {0}

$$

The /canonical projection p:/ \(p: (E - \{0\}) \to \mathbf{P}(E)\) is the function associating the equivalence class \([u]_\sim\) modulo \(\sim\) to \(u\neq0\).

The /dimension/ \(dim(\mathbf{P}(E))\) of \(\mathbf{P}(E)\) is defined as follows:

- If \(E\) is of infinite dimension: \(dim(\mathbf{P}(E)) = dim(E)\)
- If \(E\) is of finite dimension \(dim(E) = n \ge 1\): \(dim(\mathbf{P}(E)) = n-1\)
