#+title: Perspectivity

*Definition:* Given a [[id:9543A33A-0CDB-4476-87ED-87F81C2C1AE5][projective space]] \(\mathbf{P}(E)\), for any two distinct hyperplanes \(\mathbf{P}(H)\) and \(\mathbf{P}(H')\) are distinct, for any point \(c \in \mathbf{P}(E)\) neither in \(\mathbf{P}(H)\) nor in \(\mathbf{P}(H')\), the /perspectivity ([[id:2610149E-F9E8-4FEA-B51A-ABD086A91976][projective map]]) of center c/ between \(\mathbf{P}(H)\) and \(\mathbf{P}(H')\) is the map \(f: \mathbf{P}(H) \to \mathbf{P}(H')\) defined such that for every \(a \in \mathbf{P}(H)\), the point \(f(a)\) is the intersection of the line \(\langle c, a \rangle\) through \(c\) and \(a\) with \(\mathbf{P}(H')\).

*Lemma 5.4: (Gallier[[file:Gallier's%20Geometric%20Methods%20and%20Applications][1]])* Given two nontrivial vector spaces \(E\) and \(F\), for any two linear maps \(f: E \to F\) and \(g: E \to F\), we have \(\mathbf{P}(f) = \mathbf{P}(g)\) iff there is some scalar \(\lambda \in K - \{0\}\) such that \(g = \lambda f\).
