* Abstract definition
\(L^p\) can be defined as the space of measurable functions for which the \(p\)-th power is Lebesgue integrable, where functions that agree almost everywhere are identified.

Formally, let \((S, \Sigma, \mu)\) be a [[id:75B6E188-5E38-40F9-85F1-EC44C3A12D0F][measure space]] and \(1 \leq p < \infty\). The space \(\mathcal{L}^p(S, \mu)\) is form by all measurable functions \(f\) from \(S\) to \(\mathbb{C}\) or \(\mathbb{R}\) whose absolute value raised to the \(p\)-th power has a finite integral:
\[
||f||_p : = \left(\int_S |f|^p d\mu\right)^{1/p} < \infty
\]
The norm can be also extended to the case \(p = \infty\).

* Typical example
\(L^2\) usually denotes the [[id:E5B1D38D-297B-4867-91DA-75156F747A92][Hilbert Space]] form by the square integrable functions, that is, functions \(f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{C}\) such that:
\[
\int_{-\infty}^\infty |f(x)|^2\,dx < \infty
\]

Where the inner product \(\langle f,g\rangle\) for \(f, g \in L^2\) is defined as
\[
\langle f, g \rangle = \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x)\overline{g(x)}dx
\]
For both definitions, one can consider limits \(a, b\) for integration instead of \(\infty, -\infty\).
