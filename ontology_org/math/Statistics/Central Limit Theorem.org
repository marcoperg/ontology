#+title: Central Limit Theorem

The central limit theorem explains the huge number of normal distribution that we find in the natural and mathematical worlds.

The classical version of the theorem is the following

Let \(\{X_1, ... , X_n\}\) be a sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables with expected value \(\mu\) and finite variance \(\sigma^2\). Spps. we are interesting in the sample average
\[
\bar{X_n} \equiv \frac{X_1 + ... + X_n}{n}.
\]

The formal version of this version of the theorem can be stated as follows:

*Lindeberg-Levy CLT -* Spps. \(\{X_1, ..., X_n\}\) is a sequence of i.i.d. random variables with \(E[X_i]\) and \(Var[X_i] = \sigma^2 < \infty\). Then, as \(n\) approaches infinity, the random variables \(\sqrt(n)(\bar{X_n}-\mu)\) converge in distribution to a normal \(\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)\):

\[
\sqrt(n)(\bar{X_n} - \mu) \to \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)
\]
