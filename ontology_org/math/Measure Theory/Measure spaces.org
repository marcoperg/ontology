* Measurable spaces
Let \(X\) be a set and \(\mathcal{F}\) be a [[id:B697717A-34E5-4661-8B33-1AE2690CF8EA][σ-algebra]] on \(X\). Then, the tuple \((X, \mathcal{F}\)) is called a *measurable space*.

The sets in \(\mathcal{F}\) are called measurable sets.

*** Common examples
If \(X\) is countable, the σ-algebra formed by the power set of \(X\) leads to a measurable set \((X, \mathcal{P}(X))\).

If \(X\) is a [[id:C0ADBA68-2416-4041-A4E8-E3F3778D9938][topological space]], the σ-algebra formed by the [[file:Borel Sets .org][Borel sets]] \(\mathcal{B}\) leads to the measurable set \((X, \mathcal{B})\).

* Measure spaces
A measure space is a triplet \((X, \mathcal{A}, \mu)\), where - \(X\) is a set - \(\mathcal{A}\) is a σ-algebra on \(X\) - \(\mu: \mathcal{A}\to [0, \infty]\) is a function satisfying: - \(\mu(\emptyset) = 0\) - \(\mu\) is countable additive, i.e. if \(\{A_j\}_{j=0}^\infty\) is a countable collection of disjoint sets in \(\mathcal{A}\), then:
\[
    \mu(\bigcup\limits_{j=1}^{\infty} A_j) = \sum_{j=1}^\infty \mu(A_j)
     \]
