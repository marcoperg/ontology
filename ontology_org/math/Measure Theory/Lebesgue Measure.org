#+title: Lebesgue Measure

For any interval \(I = [a, b]\) in the set of reals \(\mathbb{R}\), let \(\mathscr{l}(I) = b -a\) denote its length. For any subset \(A \subset \mathbb{R}\), the Lebesgue measure \(\lambda^*(E)\) is defined as
\[
\lambda^*(E) = \inf\left\{\sum\limits_{k=1}^\infty \mathscr{l}(I_k) : (I_k)_{k\in\mathbb{N}} \text{ is a sequence of open intervals with } E \subset \bigcup_{k=1}^\infty I_k\right\}.
\]
