#+title: Space of Test Functions

--------------

aliases: - space of Test Functions
---

Let \(U\) be an open subset of the Euclidean space \(\mathbb{R}^n\). Given a non-negative integer \(k\), \(C^k(U)\) denotes de [[id:C31DD475-75D9-4BB9-9DD5-536453386F9D][vector space]] of all \(k\)-times continuously differentiable real or complex-valued functions on \(U\). And let \(C^k_c(U)\) denote the set of functions \(f \in C^k(U)\) that have [[id:8E24A191-E911-4243-8DDA-3404B256A715][compact]] [[id:DEAD4589-177E-4A11-B483-D2849B267A98][support]].

*** Definition
Elements of \(C^\infty_c(U)\) are called *test functions* on \(U\) and \(C^\infty_c(U)\) is called the *space of test functions* on \(U\). Usually, it is denoted by \(\mathcal{D}(U)\).

** Convergence of test functions
For \((\phi_k)_{k\in\mathbb{N}} \subset \mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^n)\), \(\phi \in \mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^n)\), we write \(\phi_k \to_\mathcal{D} \phi\) if 1. There is a bounded set \(M\) s.t. outside of it: \(\phi_k = 0\) for all \(k\). 2. \(\phi_k\) converges uniformly to \(\phi\) and for all [[id:1302FEFA-1598-4E04-8506-6102FCA5D425][multi-indices]] \(\alpha\)
\[ \mathcal{D}^\alpha \phi_k \to \mathcal{D}^\alpha \phi
        \]
