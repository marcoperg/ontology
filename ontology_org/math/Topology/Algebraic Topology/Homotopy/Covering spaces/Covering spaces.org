#+title: Covering spaces

* Definition
Let \(E, B\) [[id:C0ADBA68-2416-4041-A4E8-E3F3778D9938][topological spaces]]. A continuous surjective map \(p: E \to B\) is a *covering* if each \(b\in B\) has a neighborhood \(U\) which is /evenly covered/ by \(p\). That is, \(p^{-1} (U)\) is a disjoint union of open sets \(V_\alpha\), \(\alpha\) in some index set \(J\).
\[
p^{-1}(U) = \dot\bigcup_{\alpha\in J} V_\alpha
\]
and its restriction
\[
\left.p\right|_{V_\alpha}: V_\alpha \to U
\]
is a homeomorphism for all \(\alpha \in J\).

For each \(b\in B\), we call the subspace of \(E\), \(p^{-1}(b)\) the *fiber* of \(b\). All fibers have the discrete topology. \(B\) is called the base space and \((E, p)\) is the *covering space*.

Notice this forms a [[id:0E8BF171-237E-4E60-8AA0-15804304692E][fiber bundle]] with base space \(B\), total space \(E\) and projection map \(p\), the fiber is a discrete space.

* Lifting
Given a cover \(p: E \to B\). A *lifting* of a continuous function \(f: X\to B\), is a continuous map \(\tilde{f}:X\to E\) such that the following diagram commutes:

** Path lifting lemma
Let \(p: E\to B\) be a covering, \(p(e_0) = b_0\). Then, any path
\[f: [0,1] \to B\]
with \(f(0) = b_0\), has a unique lifting
\[\tilde{f}: [0, 1] \to E\]
such that \(\tilde{f}(0) = e_0\).

** Homotopy lifting lemma
Let \(p: E\to B\) be a covering, \(p(e_0) = b_0\). Then, any [[id:EA5EA1C2-B0C8-41B9-B4AE-30F98E2B5320][homotopy]]
\[F: [0,1]\times[0,1] \to B\]
with \(F(0, 0) = b_0\), has a lifting
\[\tilde{F}: [0, 1]\times[0,1] \to E\]
such that \(\tilde{F}(0, 0) = e_0\).

If \(F\) is a path-homotopy, then \(F\) is also a path-homotopy.

*** Corollary
Let \(p: E\to B\) be a covering, \(p(e_0) = b_0\). Let \(f,g\) be paths in \(B\) from \(b_0\) to \(b_1\) which are path-homotopic. And let \(\tilde{f}, \tilde{g}\) be liftings to \(E\) with initial point \(e_0\). Then also, \(\tilde{f}, \tilde{g}\) are path-homotopic with some endpoint.
