#+title: Homotopy Equivalence

* Definition
Let \(X, Y\) be [[id:C0ADBA68-2416-4041-A4E8-E3F3778D9938][topological spaces]]. Let \(f:X\to Y\) be continuous, \(f\) is a *homotopy equivalency* if there is a continuous map \(g:X \to Y\) such that
\[
\begin{align}
g \,\circ\, f \simeq \text{id}_X \\
f \,\circ\, g \simeq \text{id}_Y
\end{align}
\]
Two spaces \(X\) and \(Y\) are homotopy equivalence (or homotopic), denoted \(X \simeq Y\) if there is a homotopy equivalence between them.

** Relation with Fundamental Group
If \(X \underset{f}{\simeq} Y\), with \(f(x_0) = y_0\), then \(\pi_1(X, x_0) \cong \pi_1(Y, y_0)\).
