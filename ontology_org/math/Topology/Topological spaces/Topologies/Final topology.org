#+title: Final topology

--------------

aliases: - final topology

* Definition
Given a set \(X\) and an \(I\)-indexed family of [[id:C0ADBA68-2416-4041-A4E8-E3F3778D9938][topological space]] \((Y_i, v_i)\) with associated functions
\[f_i: Y_i\to X\]
the *final topology* on \(X\) /induced by the family of functions/ \(\mathcal{F} := \{f_i : i \in I\}\) is the finest topology \(\tau_\mathcal{F}\) on \(X\) such that
\[f_i: (Y_i, v_i) \to (X, \tau_\mathcal{F})\]
is continuous for each \(i\in I\). The final topology always exists and is unique.

Another explicit description of final topology is as follows
a subset \(U\) of \(X\) is open in the final topology if and only if \(f^{-1}(U)\) is open in \(Y_i, v_i\) for each \(i\in I\).

** Example
The important special case where the family of maps \(\mathcal{F}\) consists of a single surjective map can be completely characterized using the notion of the [[id:FE594882-26D7-43A6-86D8-AB44E105CDFA][quotient map]]. The quotient topology is the final topology on the quotient map.
