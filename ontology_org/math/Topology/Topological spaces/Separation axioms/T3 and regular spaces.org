#+title: T3 and regular spaces

aliases: - regular - regular space

Let \((X, \tau)\) be a [[id:C0ADBA68-2416-4041-A4E8-E3F3778D9938][topological space]]. \((X, \tau)\) is said to be a \(T_3\) if for all points \(x \in X\) and closed subsets \(C \subset X\) there are disjoint neighborhoods of \(x\) and \(C\).

A space that is \(T_3\) and [[id:6B3DF1E4-E443-4231-A062-491506342881][T1]] is called a *regular space*. Every regular space is [[id:14F2DB4F-672A-42CD-B683-BE90B7E3F5C9][Hausdorff]].
