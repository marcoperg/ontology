#+title: Urysohn's Lemma

Let \(X\) be a [[id:C0ADBA68-2416-4041-A4E8-E3F3778D9938][topological space]]. \(X\) is [[id:A5A52835-3BD0-4B3B-B366-3FEC36B2CA9B][normal]] iff for any closed subsets \(A, B\) of \(X\), there exists a continuous map
\[f:X \to [0,1]\]
such that \(f(A) = \{0\}\) and \(f(B) = \{1\}\). We say that \(A\) and \(B\) can be separated by a continuous real-valued function.
