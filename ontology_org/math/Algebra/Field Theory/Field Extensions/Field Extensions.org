#+title: Field Extensions

--------------

aliases: - field extension

Let \(K, E\) be [[id:0A6751A9-127F-40CA-BD65-2F69B68F0DD8][fields]]. It is said that \(E\) is an extension of \(K\) and denoted \(E/K\) is there is a [[id:0A0A0964-760B-436D-B664-BD9B0C34CC42][homomorphism]] \(j: K \to E\). Since \(K\) is a field, \(j\) is necessarily surjective, and \(K \cong(K)\).

\(K/E\) has structure of [[id:C31DD475-75D9-4BB9-9DD5-536453386F9D][vector space]] over \(K\). The /degree/ of the extension, denoted \([E : K]\), is the dimension \(dim_K E\) of \(E\) as vector space over \(K\).

** Subextension generated by subset
Let \(E/K\) be a field extension. Let
\[ A = \{ a_i : i \in I \} \subset E\]
an arbitrary subset of \(E\). We denote by \(K(A)\) the intersection of every subfield \(L \subset E\) that contains \(K\) and \(A\). Such intersection can be proven to be a field, i.e.Â the smallest field containing \(K\) and \(A\). This field \(K(A)\) is called the /field generated by \(A\) over \(K\)/.

The elements of \(K(A)\) can be described via the following. An element \(x \in E\) is in \(K(A)\) if and only if there exist \(r \geq 1\), elements \(a_1, \dots, a_r \in A\) and [[id:F75798F4-0438-46BF-802C-A0D22F95A193][polynomials]] \(f,g \in K[X_1, \dots, X_r]\) in \(r\) indeterminates \(X_1, \dots, X_r\), such that
\[
\begin{align}
g(a) \neq 0 && \& && x = \frac{f(a)}{g(a)}
\end{align}
\]
where \(a = (a_1, \dots, a_r)\).

A field extension is called /finitely generated/ when it is generated by a finite set. If such set consist of only one element then the extension is called /simple/.
