#+title: Algebraic closure

aliases: - algebraically closed - algebraic closure

* Definition
Let \(L\) a [[id:0A6751A9-127F-40CA-BD65-2F69B68F0DD8][field]], L is *algebraically closed* if the following equivalent statements hold 1. Every \(f \in L[x]\backslash L\) has a zero in L. 2. Every \(f \in L[x]\backslash L\) splits over \(L\) into linear factors, i.e.Â there are \(b, a_1, \dots, a_n \in L\) such that \(f = b(x-a_1)\dots (x-a_n)\).

Given [[id:2F01C024-2ED3-4614-BC4B-DFCF4EC04C27][field extension]] \(L/k\), \(L\) is called the *algebraic closure* of \(k\) if the field extension is algebraic and \(L\) is algebraically closed.

** Existence and uniqueness theorem
1. Every field has an algebraic closure.
2. If \(K, L\) are algebraic closures of \(k\), then there exists a \(k-\)isomorphism between \(K\) and \(L\).
