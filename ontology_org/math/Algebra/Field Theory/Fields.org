** Definition
A /field/ is a commutative [[id:3CC31C84-CF5C-4C2C-90A6-623847BFF49F][ring]] with unity in which every nonzero element is a unit.

* Characteristic
The characteristic of a field is the smallest \(n\in \mathbb{Z}\) with \(n\cdot 1 = \underbrace{1 + \cdots + 1}_\text{n-times} =0\). If such an integer does not exist the field is said to be of characteristic zero. We denote it by \(\text{char}(p)\).
