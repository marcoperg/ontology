#+title: Lattices

* Order definition
A *lattice* is a [[id:B95CB367-2854-4CA5-BF9F-81D0050E6A4A][partially ordered set]] \((P, \le)\) such that for all \(x,y \in P\) exist the infimums and supremums \(\inf\{x, y\}\) and \(\sup\{x,y\}\).

Moreover, a lattice is called *complete* if for all \(S\subseteq P\), \(\sup S\) and \(\inf S\) exist.

* Algebraic definition
A *lattice* is an algebraic structure \((L, \lor, \land)\) consisting of a set \(L\) and two binary, commutative and associative operations \(\lor\) and \(\land\) on \(L\) satisfying the following axiomatic identities for all \(a,b\in L\): 1. \(a\lor (a\land b) = a\). 2. \(a\land (a\lor b) = a\)

* Equivalency of definitions
If \(L\) is an algebraic lattice, define \(\le\) on \(L\) by \(a\le b \iff a = a\land b\).
If \(L\) is a order lattice, define \(\lor\) and \(\land\) by \(a\lor b = \sup\{a, b\}\) and \(a\land b = \inf\{a,b\}\).
