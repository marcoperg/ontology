An /algebra over a [[id:0A6751A9-127F-40CA-BD65-2F69B68F0DD8][field]]/ is a [[id:C31DD475-75D9-4BB9-9DD5-536453386F9D][vector space]] equipped with a bilinear product. Thus, an algebra is an algebraic structure consisting of a set together with operations of multiplication and addition and scalar multiplication by elements of a field and satisfying the axioms implied by "vector space" and "bilinear".
â€‹## Definition

Let \(K\) be a [[id:0A6751A9-127F-40CA-BD65-2F69B68F0DD8][field]], and let \(A\) be a [[id:C31DD475-75D9-4BB9-9DD5-536453386F9D][vector space]] over \(K\) equipped with an additional binary operation from \(A\times A\) to \(A\), denoted here by \(\cdot\) . Then \(A\) is an /algebra over \(K\)/ if the following identities hold for all elements \(x, y, z \in A\), and all elements \(a, b \in K\): - *Right distributivity*: \((x + y) \cdot z= x\cdot z + y\cdot z\) - *Left distributivity:* \(z \cdot (x+y) = z\cdot x + z\cdot y\) - *Compatibility with scalars*: \((ax) \cdot (by) = (ab)(x\cdot y)\)
These three axioms defined the operations of multiplications as bilinear.
