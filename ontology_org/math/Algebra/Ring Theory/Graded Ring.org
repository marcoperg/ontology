A *graded ring* is a [[id:3CC31C84-CF5C-4C2C-90A6-623847BFF49F][ring]] such that the underlying additive [[id:48FAF6F8-DD4A-49F5-89B1-DCE13AE4A2F7][group]] is a [[id:554A70C8-C753-4FAF-8790-791F925E4B67][direct sum]] of abelian groups \(R_i\) such that \(R_i R_j\subseteq R_{i+j}\).

That is, a *graded ring* is a ring \(R\) that is decomposed into a direct sum
\[R = \bigoplus_{n=0}^\infty R_n = R_0 \oplus R_1 \oplus\cdots\]
of additive groups such that
\[R_mR_n \subseteq R_{m+n}\]
for all nonnegative integers \(m\) and \(n\).

** Some properties and definitions
A nonzero element of \(R_n\) is said to be /homogeneous of degree/ \(n\). By definition of a direct sum every nonzero element \(a \in R\) can be uniquely written as a sum \(a = a_0 + a_1 + \cdots + a_n\) where each \(a_i\) is either \(0\) or homogeneous of degree \(i\). The nonzero \(a_i\) are the homogeneous components of \(a\).

- \(R_0\) is a subring of \(R\), in particular, the multiplicative identity \(1\) is a homogeneous element of degree \(0\).
- For any \(n\), \(R_n\) is a two-sided \(R_0\)-[[id:AC78A1AC-078C-403C-A797-2CB2A3422E51][module]], and the direct sum decomposition is a direct sum of \(R_0\)-modules.
- \(R\) is an \(R_0\)-[[file:Associative algebra.org][associative algebra]].
