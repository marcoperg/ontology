#+title: Monoid Ring

* Definition
Let \(A\) be a [[id:3CC31C84-CF5C-4C2C-90A6-623847BFF49F][ring]] and let \(G\) be a [[id:E421E5DE-E75C-4A72-BDD5-9F454CA3F6A2][monoid]]. The monoid ring of \(G\) over \(A\), denoted \(A[G]\) is the set of formal sums
\[\sum_{g\in G} r_g g \]
where \(r_g \in A\) for each \(g\in G\) and \(r_g = 0\) for all but finitely many \(g\), equipped with coefficient-wise addition, and multiplication in which elements of \(A\) commute with elements of \(G\).

** Other definition
Letting \(A[G]\) be the set of all maps \(\alpha: G \to A\) such that \(\alpha(x) = 0\) for almost all (all but finitely many) \(x\in G\). We define addition in \(A[G]\) to be the ordinary addition of mappings into an Abelian group. If \(\alpha, \beta \in A[G]\), we define their product by the rule
\[
(\alpha\beta)(z) = \sum_{xy = z} \alpha(x)\beta(y)
\]
The sum is taken over all pair \((x,y)\) with \(x,y\in G\) such that \(xy = z\). This sum is finite because there is only a finite number of pairs of elements \((x,y) \in G \times G\) such that \(\alpha(x)\beta(x)\neq 0\). We also see that \((\alpha\beta)(t)=0\) for almost all \(t\), and thus belongs to \(A[G]\).

An alternative notation that makes clearer the equivalence between definitions is the following. Let \(a\in A\) and \(x\in G\). We denote by \(a\cdot x\) the function whose value at \(x\) is \(a\), and whose value at \(y\neq x\) is \(0\). Then an element \(\alpha \in A[G]\) can be written as a sum
\[
\alpha = \sum_{x\in G} \alpha(x)\cdot x
\]
Indeed, if \(\{a_x\}_{x\in G}\) is a set of elements of \(A\) almost all of which are \(0\), and we set
\[\beta = \sum_{x\in G}a_x\cdot x\]
then for any \(y\in G\) we have \(\beta(y) = a_y\). This also shows that a given element \(\alpha\) admits a unique expression as a sum \(\sum a_x\cdot x\).
