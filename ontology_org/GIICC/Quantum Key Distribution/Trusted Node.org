#+title: Trusted Node

In the current situation of Quantum Information (QI) and Quantum Computation (QC) the lack of true quantum repeaters creates the necessity of intermediate nodes where the quantum protection of the keys is broken.

** Naive hop-2-hop version
If you can trust complete each trusted node the default protocol you may use is a hop-by-hop message transmission as depicted by [cite:@evansTrustedNodeQKD2021]

** Future lines of development
*** Reducing security assumptions
In order to reduce the security assumptions of trusted nodes there are various proposed changes: 1. One of the main ideas has been to use a *Centralised Key Management System (CKMS)*. In principle this idea secures the system against attacks to a single Trusted Node, i.e.Â the attackers would need to compromise one TN and the CKMS. As explained by [cite:@jamesKeyManagementSystems2023] this fact is not that clear and this method has its opposition. 2. *Measure Device Independent QKD (MDI-QKD)* adds the possibility of a unstrusted location at the quantum channel with the downside of requiring perfect state preparation by the two parties. This approach needs of Qubit Amplifiers and is more technically difficult, see [cite:@zapateroLongdistanceDeviceindependentQuantum2019]. This and the next approach come from the paper [cite:@mehicQKDNeworking]. 3. *Rely on multiple paths*: this is the most practical method today resorts to classic technology and employs multiple paths and threshold cryptographic techniques to mitigate the risk of eavesdropping.

*** Simplified Trusted Nodes
In order to reduce computational overhead [cite:@PhysRevA.91.012338] proposes a new type of trusted nodes called Simplified Trusted Nodes (STN). The improvement is done by doing the classical post-processing, .ie. information reconciliation and privacy amplification, only in the end-nodes Alice and Bob in contrast to classical TN that does it on all intermediary nodes. This in a way enforces a better approximation of the [[id:DD1C574E-AF12-48EF-B91B-2A2796E86750][End-to-end principle]] of computer networking.

There are also arguments about STNs having security advantages over more traditional TNs. Mainly, that if an adversary compromises a STN ti would only get the raw key information, lacking the later privacy amplification information that only occurs on the end-points in this paradigm. For more on this and a Finite-Key security proof of this type of QKD see [cite:@krawec2024finite].

*** Preguntas MadQKD
- Does MadQKD uses STN in any connection? Can it use it? Or is a manufacturing thing of the QKD modules?
- Does MADQKD uses a Centralised Key Management System? Has it been considered?
