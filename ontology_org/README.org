* Ontology

#+begin_quote
In information science, an ontology encompasses a representation, formal
naming, and definitions of the categories, properties, and relations between
the concepts, data, or entities that pertain to one, many, or all domains of
discourse.

Following the spirit of this definition this collection of obsidian notes on
different subjects forms in a way my personal ontology of knowledge.

The specific selection of topics and the reason behind them may vary, usually I
write about what I want to understand deeper, either the topic itself or its
connections to thing in other subject.
