A _pure_ state is a state that can be described by a single ket vector. A _mixed_ state is a statistical ensemble of pure sates. _Mixed_ state arise in two different situations:

One, the observer may not fully known how the preparations of the system was done. In this case, another observer can know the exact details, and in this case for the second observer the state would be pure.

Second, when one wants to describe a system entangled with another unknown system in a non separable way. Let the composite quantum system $H_1 \otimes H_2$ be in an entangled state, and let $H_2$ be inaccessible to the observer. Then the state of $H_1$ can be expressed as a partial trace over $H_2$, given a statistical ensemble of pure states in $H_1$, but not one vector inside the [[Hilbert Spaces|Hilbert Space]].
