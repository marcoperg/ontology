This is a type of [[Policy Gradient]] [[Reinforcement Learning|RL]] algorithm that uses a Clipped Surrogate Objective in order to achieve better robustness and efficiency. It has first introduced in [@schulmanProximalPolicyOptimization2017]. It can also be implemented as a [[Actor Critic]] algorithm.

## Distributed PPO

As shown in [@heessEmergenceLocomotionBehaviours2017] PPO can be done efficiency in a distributed environment.
