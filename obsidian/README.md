Following the spirit of this definition this collection of obsidian notes on
different subjects forms in a way my personal ontology of knowledge.

The specific selection of topics and the reason behind them may vary, usually I
write about what I want to understand deeper, either the topic itself or its
connections to thing in other subject.
