## Utilities
- Request to create new link (openConnect).
- Request for entanglement (getEntanglement).

## Requirements
Similar to a KMS, save in a dictionary information about each active link.
About each link saves:
- Age
		- Needs to be recomputed after each swap. Either by assuming the age of the oldest link or by re-computing the age based on the post-swap fidelity ([@inestaOptimalEntanglementDistribution2023]).
- Session ID
