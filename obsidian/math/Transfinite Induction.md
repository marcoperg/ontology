Transfinite induction, like regular induction, is used to show a property $P(n)$ holds for all numbers $n$. 

The $A$ be a well ordered set and let $P(x)$ be a proposition with domain $A$. A proof by transfinite induction uses the following steps:
1. Show $P(0)$ is true.
2. Assume $P(b)$ for all $b < a$.
3. Show $P(a)$, using assumption in (2).
4. Then $P(a)$ is true for all $a \in A$.

The first transfinite induction methods were develop by Cantor to prove various results in point-set topology. Zermelo (1904) extended Cantor's original method with a "proof that every set can be well-ordered", which became [[Zorn's Lemma]]. Transfinite induction and Zorn's lemma are often used interchangeably, or are strongly linked.
