Depending if one is working in a proof theory or a model theory setting it makes sense to use one of two kinds of consequence in logic.

## Syntactic Consequence ($\vdash$)

A formula $A$ is a syntactic consequence within a [[Formal Theory |formal theory]] (or formal system) $\mathcal{FS}$ of a set $\Gamma$ of formulas if there is a formal proof in $\mathcal{FS}$ of $A$ from the set $\Gamma$. This is denoted $\Gamma \vdash_{\mathcal{FS}}A$.

## Semantic Consequence ($\vDash$)

A formula $A$ is a semantic consequence within a or formal system $\mathcal{FS}$ of a set $\Gamma$ of formulas iff there is no [[Structure|model]] $\mathcal{I}$ in which all member of $\Gamma$ are true and $A$ is false. This is denoted $\Gamma \vDash_{\mathcal{FS}}A$.
