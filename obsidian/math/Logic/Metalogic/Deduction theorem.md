The deduction theorem is a metatheorem that justifies conditional proofs in first-order logic.

# Statement

Let $\Delta$ be a set of first-order sentences, and $A$ and $B$ formulas. If $\Delta \cup \{A\} \vdash B$, then $\Delta \vdash A\to B$.

This theorem holds in all first-order theories with the usual deductive systems. However, there are first-order systems in which new inference rules are added for which the deduction theorem fails. Most notably, the deduction theorem fails to hold in Birkhoff–von Neumann quantum logic, because the linear subspaces of a Hilbert space form a non-distributive lattice.
