The Ramsey number $R(s, t)$ is the minimum number $n$ such that any [[Graphs|graph]] on $n$ vertices contains either an independent set of size $s$ or a clique of size $t$.

The Ramsey number $R_k(s_1, s_2, \dots , s_k)$ is the minimum number $n$ such that any coloring of the edges of $K_n$ with $k$ colors contains a clique of size $s_i$ in color $i$, for some $i$.

# Ramsey's theorem

For any $s,t\ge 1$, there is $R(s,t)<\infty$ such that any graph on $R(s,t)$ vertices contains an independent set of size $s$ or a clique of size $t$. In particular
$$R(s,t) \le\binom{s+t-2}{s-1}.$$
