Given two [[Metric spaces|metric spaces]] $X$ and $Y$ with metrics $d_X$ and $d_Y$. A map $f: X\to Y$ is called an **isometry** or **distance preserving map** if for all $a, b \in X$ we have:
$$
d_X(a, b) = d_Y(f(a), f(b)).
$$
An isometry is automatically injective, otherwise we would have two different point being map to the same one which would decrease the distance to zero.

## Example
Given a transformation $U$ on a [[Hilbert Spaces|Hilbert Space]] if we have $U^*U = I$, the columns of $U$ are orthogonal and then $U$ is an isometry.
