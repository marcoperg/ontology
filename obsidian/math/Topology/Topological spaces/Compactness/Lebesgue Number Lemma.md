Let $\mathscr{A}$ be an open covering of the [[Compactness|sequentially compact]], [[Metric spaces|metric space]] $X$. Then, there exists a $\delta > 0$, called the Lebesgue number associated to the covering $\mathscr{A}$ such that every subset of $X$ whose diameter is less than $\delta$ is contained in at least one $A \in \mathscr{A}$.
