## Path

Let $X$ be a [[Topological spaces|topological space]]. A continuous function $f: [0, 1] \to X$ is called a **path** in $X$. The path $f$ is said to _connect_ the point $f(0)$ to the point $f(1)$. If $f$ is a path, $f([0,1])$ is called a _curve_ in $X$.

## Path-connectedness definition

A topological space $X$ is said to be **path-connected** if, for each pair of point $x, v \in X$, there is a path $f$ connecting $u$ to $v$.

A path whose initial and terminal point coincide is called a _loop_ in $X$.

Every path-connected topological space is [[Connectedness|connected]]. But the converse is not true, e.g. the orderer square $I^2_o$ is connected but not path connected; the closure of the topologist's sine curve also is connected but not path-conneted.
