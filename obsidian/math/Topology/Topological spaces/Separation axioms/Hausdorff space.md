## Definition

Let $(X, \tau)$ be a [[Topological spaces|topological space]]. $(X, \tau)$ is said to be an _Hausdorff space_  or $T_2$ if for all points $x, y$ there exist a neighborhood $V$ of $x$ and a neighborhood $U$ of $y$ such that $U \cap V = \emptyset$. That is, if any two points of the space are separated by neighborhoods.

The condition for being a Hausdorff space are important to ensure the uniqueness of limits on the space.
