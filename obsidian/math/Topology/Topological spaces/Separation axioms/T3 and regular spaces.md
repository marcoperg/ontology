Let $(X, \tau)$ be a [[Topological spaces|topological space]]. $(X, \tau)$ is said to be a $T_3$ if for all points $x \in X$ and closed subsets $C \subset X$ there are disjoint neighborhoods of $x$ and $C$.

A space that is $T_3$ and [[T1 space|T1]] is called a **regular space**. Every regular space is [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]].
