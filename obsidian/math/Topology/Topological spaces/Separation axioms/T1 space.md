Let $(X, \tau)$ be a [[Topological spaces|topological space]]. $(X, \tau)$ is said to be a $T_1$ if for all points $x, y \in X$, $y$ has a neighborhood not containing $X$.

## Proposition

X is $T_1$ iff singletons of points are closed.

## Exempli gratia

The finite complement topology over any set $X$ is $T_1$. Moreover,s not [[Hausdorff space]] if $X$ is infinite.
