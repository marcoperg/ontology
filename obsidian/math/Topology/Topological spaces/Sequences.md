Let $X$ be a [[Topological spaces|topological space]]. Then a sequence $x_1, x_2,\dots$ in $X$ is said to converge to $x\in X$ if for every neighborhood $U$ of $x$ there is some $N\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $a_n \in U$ for all $n>N$.

Every convergent sequence has a unique limit in a [[Hausdorff space]].

## Sequence lemma

For a subset $A\subset X$, if there is a sequence in $A$ which converges to $x \in X$ then $x \in \overline{A}$.
Conversely, if $X$ is [[Countability|first countable]], if $x\in \overline{A}$ then there is a sequence in $A$ which converges to $x$.
