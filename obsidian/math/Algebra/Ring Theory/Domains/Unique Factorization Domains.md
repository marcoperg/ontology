A [[Rings|ring]] $R$ is called a unique factorization domain (UFD) if it is an [[Integral Domains|integral domain]] in which the following conditions are satisfied:
1. Every irreducible element is [[Ideals and Quotient Rings|prime]].
2. Every not null element that is not a unit is the product of irreducible elements.

An irreducible element $p$ is a not unit, not null element of the ring for which $p = ab$ for $a,b \in R$ implies $a$ or $b$ unit. Every [[Principal Ideal Domains|principal ideal domain]] is a UFD.
