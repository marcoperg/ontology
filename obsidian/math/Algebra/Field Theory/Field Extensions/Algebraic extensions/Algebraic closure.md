# Definition

Let $L$ a [[Fields|field]], L is **algebraically closed** if the following equivalent statements hold
1. Every $f \in L[x]\backslash L$ has a zero in L.
2. Every $f \in L[x]\backslash L$ splits over $L$ into linear factors, i.e. there are $b, a_1, \dots, a_n \in L$ such that $f = b(x-a_1)\dots (x-a_n)$.

Given [[Field Extensions|field extension]] $L/k$, $L$ is called the **algebraic closure** of $k$ if the field extension is algebraic and $L$ is algebraically closed.

## Existence and uniqueness theorem

1. Every field has an algebraic closure.
2. If $K, L$ are algebraic closures of $k$, then there exists a $k-$isomorphism between $K$ and $L$.
