Let $K, E$ be [[Fields|fields]]. It is said that $E$ is an extension of $K$ and denoted $E/K$ is there is a [[Ring Homomorphism|homomorphism]] $j: K \to E$. Since $K$ is a field, $j$ is necessarily surjective, and $K \cong(K)$.

$K/E$ has structure of [[Vector spaces|vector space]] over $K$. The *degree* of the extension, denoted $[E : K]$, is the dimension $dim_K E$ of $E$ as vector space over $K$.

## Subextension generated by subset

Let $E/K$ be a field extension. Let
$$ A = \{ a_i : i \in I \} \subset E$$
an arbitrary subset of $E$. We denote by $K(A)$ the intersection of every subfield $L \subset E$ that contains $K$ and $A$. Such intersection can be proven to be a field, i.e. the smallest field containing $K$ and $A$. This field $K(A)$ is called the *field generated by $A$ over $K$*.

The elements of $K(A)$ can be described via the following. An element $x \in E$ is in $K(A)$ if and only if there exist $r \geq 1$, elements $a_1, \dots, a_r \in A$ and [[Polynomial Rings|polynomials]] $f,g \in K[X_1, \dots, X_r]$ in $r$ indeterminates $X_1, \dots, X_r$, such that
$$
\begin{align}
g(a) \neq 0 && \& && x = \frac{f(a)}{g(a)}
\end{align}
$$
where $a = (a_1, \dots, a_r)$.

A field extension is called *finitely generated* when it is generated by a finite set. If such set consist of only one element then the extension is called *simple*.
