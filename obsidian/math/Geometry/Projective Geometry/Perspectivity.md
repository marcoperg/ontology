**Definition:** Given a [[Projective spaces|projective space]] $\mathbf{P}(E)$, for any two distinct hyperplanes $\mathbf{P}(H)$ and $\mathbf{P}(H')$ are distinct, for any point $c \in \mathbf{P}(E)$ neither in $\mathbf{P}(H)$ nor in $\mathbf{P}(H')$, the _perspectivity ([[Projective maps|projective map]]) of center c_ between $\mathbf{P}(H)$ and $\mathbf{P}(H')$ is the map $f: \mathbf{P}(H) \to \mathbf{P}(H')$   defined such that for every $a \in \mathbf{P}(H)$, the point $f(a)$ is the intersection of the line $\langle c, a \rangle$ through $c$ and $a$ with $\mathbf{P}(H')$.

**Lemma 5.4: (Gallier[1])**  Given two nontrivial vector spaces $E$ and $F$, for any two linear maps $f: E \to F$ and $g: E \to F$, we have $\mathbf{P}(f) = \mathbf{P}(g)$ iff there is some scalar $\lambda \in K - \{0\}$ such that $g = \lambda f$.
