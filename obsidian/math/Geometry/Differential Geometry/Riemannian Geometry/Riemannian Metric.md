A **Riemannian metric** on a [[Manifolds|manifold]] $M$ is a smooth symmetric covariant $2$-[[Tensors and Tensor Fields on Manifolds|tensor field]] that is positive definite at each point. A **Riemannian manifold** is a pair $(M, g)$, where $M$ is a smooth manifold and $g$ is a Riemannian metric.

In smooth local coordinates $(x^i)$, a Riemannian metric can be written
$$g = g_{ij}\,dx^i\otimes dx^j.$$
