  - metric signature
---
The signature of a metric tensor is defined as the number $(v, p, r)$ of positive, negative and zero eigenvalues of any matrix (i.e. in any basis for the underlying vector space) representing the form, counted with their algebraic multiplicities. Usually, $r = 0$ is required, which is the same as saying a metric tensor must be [[Degenerate bilinear form|non-degenerate]], i.e. no nonzero vector is orthogonal to all vectors.
