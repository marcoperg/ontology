Given a [[Manifolds|smooth manifold]] $M$ we define the **tangent bundle**, denoted $TM$, to be the disjoint union of the [[Tangent Space|tangent space]] at all points of $M$:
$$TM = \coprod_{p\in M} T_pM$$
Elements of $TM$ can be written as a pair $(p, v)$ with $p\in M$ and $v \in T_pM$. The tangent bundle comes equipped with a natural **projection map** $\pi: TM \to M: (p, v)\mapsto p$. Since each fiber of this map is a vector space the tangent bundle is a [[Vector Bundles|vector bundle]].

Also, for any $n$-manifold, the tangent bundle $TM$ has a natural [[Topological spaces|topology]] and smooth structure that makes it into a $2n$-dimensional smooth manifold. With respect to this structure, the projection $\pi:TM \to M$ is smooth.
