In this work we provide an overview of a KMS in the context of Quantum Key Distribution Networks (QKDN) and give a thorough summary of the functionality of a KMS in such an application. Beyond classical QKDNs, we discuss Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) hybridization techniques at the KMS level. These methods add an additional layer of security against quantum computer driven attacks. We also discuss selected topics regarding the development, deployment and operation of components for such security infrastructure. In addition, relevant standards in the realm of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) are outlined and analyzed. As some of the necessary interfaces have not been standardized, namely the interface between two KMS instances and the interface between the KMS and the Software Defined Network (SDN) Agent, we propose APIs for these two cases. The design of the interface between the KMS and QKD modules is discussed and, considering their resource constraints, a push mode for the ETSI GS QKD 004 standard is proposed. Finally, implementation details of a prototype KMS are outlined and trade-offs are discussed.","author":[{"family":"James","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Laschet","given":"Stephan"},{"family":"Ramacher","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Torresetti","given":"Luca"}],"citation-key":"jamesKeyManagementSystems2023","collection-title":"ARES '23","container-title":"Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security","DOI":"10.1145/3600160.3605050","event-place":"<conf-loc>, <city>Benevento</city>, <country>Italy</country>, </conf-loc>","ISBN":"9798400707728","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","title":"Key Management Systems for Large-Scale Quantum Key Distribution Networks","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3600160.3605050"},{"id":"Qureshi_2022","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Quantum state teleportation is an important protocol that plays a pivotal role in various quantum information tasks. Here we theoretically investigate quantum state teleportation by exploiting a general two-mode Gaussian entangled state produced by a parametric converter when two single-mode Gaussian states (SMGSs) in terms of the non-classicality and purity are employed as inputs to the parametric converter. In particular, the time-dependent teleportation fidelity is analyzed with respect to the squeezing parameter and phase-space quadratures of the teleported squeezed coherent state. We show that the teleportation fidelity is maximal when ratio of the expectation values of photon number in the two modes of the evolved Gaussian entangled state is equal to 1. Quantum state teleportation in terms of the purity and non-classicality of the general two SMGSs seems to be a good choice for experimental realization of quantum communication and information processing.","container-title":"Journal of Physics B: Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics","DOI":"10.1088/1361-6455/ac7370","issue":"14","note":"Citation Key: Qureshi_2022\npublisher: IOP Publishing","page":"145501","title":"Time-dependent quantum teleportation via a parametric converter","URL":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1361-6455/ac7370","volume":"55","author":[{"family":"Qureshi","given":"Haleema Sadia"},{"family":"Ullah","given":"Shakir"},{"family":"Ghafoor","given":"Fazal"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",6]]},"citation-key":"Qureshi_2022","library":"My Library","citekey":"Qureshi_2022"},{"id":"zapateroLongdistanceDeviceindependentQuantum2019","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Besides being a beautiful idea, device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) is probably the ultimate solution to defeat quantum hacking. Its security is based on a loophole-free violation of a Bell inequality, which results in a very limited maximum achievable distance. To overcome this limitation, DIQKD must be furnished with heralding devices like, for instance, qubit amplifiers, which can signal the arrival of a photon before the measurement settings are actually selected. In this way, one can decouple channel loss from the selection of the measurement settings and, consequently, it is possible to safely post-select the heralded events and discard the rest, which results in a significant enhancement of the achievable distance. In this work, we investigate photonic-based DIQKD assisted by two main types of qubit amplifiers in the finite data block size scenario, and study the resources—particularly, the detection efficiency of the photodetectors and the quality of the entanglement sources—that would be necessary to achieve long-distance DIQKD within a reasonable time frame of signal transmission.","container-title":"Scientific Reports","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-019-53803-0","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","journalAbbreviation":"Scientific Reports","page":"17749","title":"Long-distance device-independent quantum key distribution","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-53803-0","volume":"9","author":[{"family":"Zapatero","given":"Víctor"},{"family":"Curty","given":"Marcos"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",11,28]]},"citation-key":"zapateroLongdistanceDeviceindependentQuantum2019","library":"My Library","citekey":"zapateroLongdistanceDeviceindependentQuantum2019"},{"id":"PhysRevA.91.012338","type":"article-journal","container-title":"Physical Review A: Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics","DOI":"10.1103/PhysRevA.91.012338","issue":"1","journalAbbreviation":"Phys.

One significant problem is that the security of the final key strongly depends on the number, M, of signals exchanged between the legitimate parties. Yet, existing security proofs are often only valid asymptotically, for unrealistically large values of M. Another challenge is that most security proofs are very sensitive to small differences between the physical devices used by the protocol and the theoretical model used to describe them. Here we show that these gaps between theory and experiment can be simultaneously overcome by using a recently developed proof technique based on the uncertainty relation for smooth entropies.","container-title":"Nature Communications","DOI":"10.1038/ncomms1631","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","journalAbbreviation":"Nature Communications","page":"634","title":"Tight finite-key analysis for quantum cryptography","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms1631","volume":"3","author":[{"family":"Tomamichel","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Lim","given":"Charles Ci Wen"},{"family":"Gisin","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Renner","given":"Renato"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",1,17]]},"citation-key":"tomamichelTightFinitekeyAnalysis2012","library":"My Library","citekey":"tomamichelTightFinitekeyAnalysis2012"},{"id":"krawec2024finite","type":"article-journal","note":"Citation Key: krawec2024finite\narXiv: 2404.17420 [quant-ph]","title":"Finite key security of simplified trusted node networks","author":[{"family":"Krawec","given":"Walter O."},{"family":"Wang","given":"Bing"},{"family":"Brown","given":"Ryan"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"citation-key":"krawec2024finite","library":"My Library","citekey":"krawec2024finite"}]
