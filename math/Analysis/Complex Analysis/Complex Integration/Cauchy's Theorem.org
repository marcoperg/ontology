#+title: Cauchy's Theorem

Let \(f(z)\) be [[id:3C67CDAF-C6A1-459F-8733-49487370C514][analytic]] in a region \(\mathcal{R}\) and on its boundary \(C\). Then
\[
\oint_C f(z)\,dz=0
\]
This fundamental theorem, of called /Cauchy's integral theorem/ is valid for both [[id:886F9E7C-95BA-437B-977F-637686061F7E][simply and connected regions]]. It was first proved by use of [[id:44309D61-78BD-44CD-9C05-9AA2FED0D94E][Green's Theorem in Plane]] with the added restriction that \(f'(z)\) be continuous in \(\mathcal{R}\). However, /Goursat/ gave a proof which removed this restriction. For this reason, the theorem is sometimes called /Cauchy-Goursat theorem/.

** Some consequences
Let \(f(z)\) be analytic in a simply-connected region \(\mathcal{R}\). Then we have the following corollaries of cauchy's theorem

*** Corollary 1
Suppose \(a\) and \(z\) are any two points in \(\mathcal{R}\). Then
\[
\int_a^z f(z)\,dz
\]
is independent of the path in \(\mathcal{R}\) joining \(a\) and \(z\).

*** Corollary 2
Suppose \(a\) and \(z\) are any two points in \(\mathcal{R}\) and
\[
G(z) = \int_a^z f(z)\,dz.
\]
Then \(G(z)\) is analytic in \(\mathcal{R}\) and \(G'(z) = f(z)\)$ .

*** Corollary 3
Suppose \(a\) and \(z\) are any two points in \(\mathcal{R}\) and \(F'(z) = f(z)\). Then
\[
\int_a^b f(z)\,dz = F(b) - F(a)
\]

*** Corollary 4
Let \(f(z)\) be analytic in a region bounded by two simple closed curves \(C\) and \(C_1\), where \(C_1\) lies inside \(C\), and on these curves. Then
\[
\oint_C f(z)\,dz = \oint_{C_1} f(z)\,dz
\]
where \(C\) and \(C_1\) are both traversed in the positive sense relative to their interiors (i.e.Â counter-clockwise).

*** Corollary 5
Let \(f(z)\) be analytic in a region bounded by the non-overlapping simple closed curves \(C, C_1, C_2, C_3, ..., C_n\) where \(C_1, C_2, ..., C_n\) are inside \(C\) and on these curves. Then
\[
\oint_C f(z)\,dz = \oint_{C_1} f(z)\,dz + \oint_{C_2} f(z)\,dz + ... + \oint_{C_n} f(z)\,dz
\]
This generalised Corollary 4.
