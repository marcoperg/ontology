** Definition
A function \(f(z)\) that fails to be [[id:3C67CDAF-C6A1-459F-8733-49487370C514][analytic]] at \(z = z_0\) is said to have a singularity at \(z_0\).

** Classification by Laurent's series
Is it possible to classify the singularities of a function \(f(z)\) by examination of its [[id:16023FE0-4DAE-47CB-8ECF-59FD7A7C6AB2][Laurent's series]]. For this, we assume that \(f(z)\) is analytic inside a curve \(C_1\) except at \(z= a\).

- *Poles:* If \(f(z)\) has a Laurent series in which the principal part has only a finite number of terms given by
  \[
  \frac{a_{-1}}{z-a} + \frac{a_{-2}}{(z-a)^2}+\frac{a_{-3}}{(z-a)^3}+\dots +\frac{a_{-n}}{(z-a)^n}
  \]
  where \(a_{-n} \neq 0\), then \(z=a\) is called a /pole of order \(n\)/. If \(n=1\), it is called a /simple pole/.
  If \(f(z)\) has a pole at \(z=a\), then \(\lim_{z\to a} f(z) = \infty\).

- *Removable singularity:* If a single-valued function \(f(z)\) is not defined at \(z=a\) but \(\lim_{z\to a} f(z)\) exists, then \(z = a\) is called a /removable singularity/. In such a case, we define \(f(z)\) at \(z=a\) as equal to \(\lim_{z\to a}f(z)\), and \(f(z)\) will be analytic at \(a\).

- *Essential singularities:* If \(f(z)\) is a single-valued function, then any singularity that is not a pole or a removable singularity is called a /essential singularity/.

- *Singularities at infinity:* By letting \(z = 1/w\) in \(f(z)\), we obtain the function \(f(1/w) = F(w)\), Then the nature of the singularity for \(f(z)\) at \(z=\infty\) is defined to be the same as \(F(w)\) at \(w = 0\).

** Entire function
A function that is analytic everywhere in the finite plane (i.e.Â everywhere except at the point at infinity) is called an /entire function/ or /integral function/.

** Meromorphic function
A function that is analytic everywhere except in the finite plane at a finite number of poles is called a /meromorphic function/.
