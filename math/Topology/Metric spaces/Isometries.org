#+title: Isometries

Given two [[id:09723E35-01DA-4F26-B3BD-B3CF4C94EBDC][metric spaces]] \(X\) and \(Y\) with metrics \(d_X\) and \(d_Y\). A map \(f: X\to Y\) is called an *isometry* or *distance preserving map* if for all \(a, b \in X\) we have:
\[
d_X(a, b) = d_Y(f(a), f(b)).
\]
An isometry is automatically injective, otherwise we would have two different point being map to the same one which would decrease the distance to zero.

** Example
Given a transformation \(U\) on a [[id:E5B1D38D-297B-4867-91DA-75156F747A92][Hilbert Space]] if we have \(U^*U = I\), the columns of \(U\) are orthogonal and then \(U\) is an isometry.
