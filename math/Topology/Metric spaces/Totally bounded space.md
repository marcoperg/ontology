Total-boundedness is a generalisation of [[Compactness|compactness]] for circumstances where the set is not necessarily closed.
## Defintion

A [[Metric spaces|metric space]] $(M,d)$ is **totally bounded** if and only if for every number $\epsilon >0$ there exist a finite collection of open balls of radius $\epsilon > 0$ whose centers line in $M$ an whose union contains $M$.
