# Definition on metrics spaces

Given a [[Metric spaces|metric space]] $(M, d)$, a subset $S \subset M$ is bounded if exists $r > 0$ such that for all $s, t\in S$ we have $d(s,t)<r$.

A metric space is said to be bounded if is bounded as a subset of itself.

## Interesting theorems

- [[Totally bounded space|Total boundedness]] imply boundedness.
- A metric space is [[Compactness|compact]] if and only if it is [[Complete Metric Spaces|complete]] and totally bounded.
- A subset of euclidian space $\mathbb{R}^n$ is compact iff it is closed and bounded. This is called Heine-Borel theorem.
