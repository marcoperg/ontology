A [[id:C0ADBA68-2416-4041-A4E8-E3F3778D9938][topological space]] \(X\) is called *semilocally simply-connected* if each point \(x\in X\) has a neighborhood \(U\) such that the inclusion-induced map \(\pi_1(U, x) \hookrightarrow \pi_1(X, x)\) is trivial. That is, all points of \(X\) have a neighborhood where all loops are homotopic to a point.
