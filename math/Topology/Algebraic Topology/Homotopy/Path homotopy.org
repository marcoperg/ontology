#+title: Path homotopy

aliases: - homotopy

Let \(F_0, F_1\) be two paths in a topological space \(X\) with the same initial point \(p_0 = F_0(0) = F_1(0)\) and the same terminal point \(p_1 = F_0(1) = F_1(1)\). \(F_0\) is said to be *homotopic* to \(F_1\) if there is a continuous function \(H: I^2 \to X\) such that
\[
\begin{align}
&H(0, t) = p_0, &0\leq t\leq 1, \\
&H(1, t) = p_1, &0\leq t\leq 1, \\
&H(x, 0) = F_0(x), &0\leq x\leq 1, \\
&H(x, 1) = F_1(x), &0\leq x\leq 1, \\
\end{align}
\]
The function \(H\) is called a _homotopy connection \(F_0\) to \(F_1\).
The interpretation of the homotopy is a continuous deformation of one path into the other.

If two paths \(F_0\) and \(F_1\) are homotopic to each other we denote it by \(F_0 \cong F_1\).

The relation of being homotopic forms an equivalence relation. An equivalence set of homotopic paths is called a /homotopy class of paths/. At a point \(z\) in a topological space \(Z\) the collection of homotopy classes of closed paths at \(z\) is denoted by \(\Pi(Z, z)\). Among these homotopy classes there is the homotopy class \([e_z]\), where \(e_z\) is the /constant/ path defined by \(e_z(t) = z\), \(0 \leq t \leq 1\).

The set \(\Pi(Z, z)\) forms a group under the operation of /concatenation/ of path:
Let \(F, G: I \to Z\) be closed paths at \(z \in Z\). Define \(F \cdot G : I \to Z\) by
$$
\begin{align}
&(F\cdot G)(t) = F(2t), &0\leq t \leq \frac{1}{2}\\
&(F\cdot G)(t) = G(2t-1), &\frac{1}{2}\leq t \leq 1 \\

\end{align}
$$
