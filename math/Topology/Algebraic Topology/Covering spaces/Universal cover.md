# Universal cover

Let $B$ be a [[Path-connected|path-connected]] space, a simply-connected [[Covering spaces|covering space]] of $B$ is also a covering space of every other path-connected covering space of $B$. Such a covering is unique up to isomorphism and is referred to as **universal cover**.


# Theorem

A connected, locally path-connected space $X$ has a universal cover if and only if it is [[Semilocally simply-connected space|semilocally simply-connected]].
