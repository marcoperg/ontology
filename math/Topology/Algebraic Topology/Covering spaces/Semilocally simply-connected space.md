A [[Topological spaces|topological space]] $X$ is called **semilocally simply-connected** if each point $x\in X$ has a neighborhood $U$ such that the inclusion-induced map $\pi_1(U, x) \to \pi_1(X, x)$ is trivial. That is, all points of $X$ have a neighborhood where all loops are homotopic to a point.
