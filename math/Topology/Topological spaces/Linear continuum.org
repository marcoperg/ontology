#+title: Linear continuum

** Definition
An ordered set \(X\) is a *linear continuum* if the following conditions hold: 1. Any non-empty bounded subset of \(X\) has a least upper bound. 2. For all \(x,y \in X\) such that \(x<y\) there exist \(z\in X\) with \(x<z<y\).

e.g.Â  - \(\mathbb{R}\) (yes) - \(\mathbb{Q}\) (no, Dedekind's cut proves 1) does not hold). - \(\mathbb{Z}\) (no)

** Theorem
If \(X\) is a linear continuum, then \(X\) is [[id:2853D3BA-42CD-4A57-A958-9BC537946A64][connected]] and, also, every interval and ray is connected under the order topology.

*** Corollary
\(\mathbb{R}\) is connected.
