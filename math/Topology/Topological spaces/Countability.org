** First-countable space
A [[id:C0ADBA68-2416-4041-A4E8-E3F3778D9938][topological space]] a is said to be /first countable/ at point \(x \in X\) if it exists a countable system of neighborhoods \(U_1, U_2, U_3, \dots\) such that given an arbitrary neighborhood \(U\) of \(x\) there is \(n\in \mathbb{N}\) such that \(U_n \subset U\).

We can safely assume that \(U_1 \supset U_2 \supset U_3 \supset \dots\) (by \(U_1 \supset (U_1 \cap U_2)\supset (U_1\cap U_2 \cap U_3) \supset \dots\)). Then \(U_i \subset U\), for \(i\ge n\) is called the fundamental system of neighborhoods of \(x\).

Then \(X\) is called first countable if it is first countable at every point.

*** E.g.
If \(X\) is metric, then \(X\) is first countable, taking \(U_i = B_d(x, \frac{1}{i})\).

** Second-countable space
A topological space \((X, \tau)\) is said to be /second countable/ if it exists a countable [[id:CDB04BD2-C2D2-400F-8C70-F3CFF4097980][basis]] that generates the space.

Second-countable implies first-countable.
