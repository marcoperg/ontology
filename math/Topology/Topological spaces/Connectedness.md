## Definition
A [[Topological spaces|topological space]] $A$ is said to be _connected_ if the only two subsets of $X$ that are simultaneously open and close are $X$ itself and the empty set $\emptyset$. A topological space which is not connected is said to be _disconnected_.

Thus, a topological space $X$ is disconnected iff there are two non-empty open disjoint subset $P$ and $Q$ whose union is $X$, (i.e. $P\space\dot{\cup}\space Q = X$).

Since every subset $A$ of a topological space $X$ is itself a topological space under the relative topology. We say that the subset $A$ is connected if the topological space $A$ with the relative topology is connected.
