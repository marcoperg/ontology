## Definition

Given a [[Topological spaces|topological space]] $(X, \tau)$, a **basis** for the topology $\tau$ is a set $\mathcal{B} \subseteq \tau$ of open sets such that every open set of the topology ca be represented as the union of some subset of $\mathcal{B}$. In symbols,

For all open set $O \in \tau$ exists a subset $\{A_i\}_{i\in I}$ such that $O = \bigcup_{i \in I} AI_i$.

## Example
Let $(X, \tau)$ be the topological space induced by the [[Metric spaces|metric space]] $(X, d)$. Then, the set of open balls $\mathcal{B} = \{B_\epsilon(x)\,|\, x\in X, \epsilon >0\}$ is a basis for $\tau$.

##  Second-countable space
A topological space $(X, \tau)$ is said to be _second countable_ if it exist a countable base.
