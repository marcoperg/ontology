** Definition
Let \((X, \tau)\) be a [[id:C0ADBA68-2416-4041-A4E8-E3F3778D9938][topological space]] and \(A \subseteq X\), A is said to be *compact* if for all covers \(\{U_i\}_{i\in I}\) of \(A\) there exist a finite subcover \(\{U_i\}_{i \in I_0 \subseteq I}\). In symbols,
\[
\bigcup_{i\in I} U_i \supseteq A\text{ with } U_i\in \tau \implies \exists \text{ finite } I_0 \subseteq I: \bigcup_{i\in I_0} U_i \supseteq A
\]
â€‹## Properties

- Let \((X, \tau)\) be a [[id:14F2DB4F-672A-42CD-B683-BE90B7E3F5C9][Hausdorff space]], then all compact sets \(A\) are closed.
- *Tychonoff Theorem*: the [[id:22783D02-0670-4A34-B1FA-EDD8C5139B77][product]] of compact spaces is compact.

** Other types of compactness
*** Limit point compact
A space \(X\) is said to be *limit point compact* if every infinite subset has a limit point.

\(X\) compact implies \(X\) limit point compact.

*** Sequentially compact
A space \(X\) is said to be *sequentially compact* if every sequence in \(X\) has a convergent subsequence.

In a metric space compactness, limit point compactness and sequential compactness are equivalent.

** Heine--Borel theorem
The theorem states that for a subset \(S\) of the Euclidean space \(\mathbb{R}^n\), the following statements are equivalent: - \(S\) is closed and [[file:Bounded set .org][bounded]]. - \(S\) is compact.
