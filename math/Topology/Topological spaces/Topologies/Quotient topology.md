# Quotient map

 Let $X, Y$ be [[Topological spaces|topological spaces]]. Then a function $f: X \to Y$ is a **quotient map** if it is subjective and the following holds:
$$V\subset Y \text{ is open in } Y \iff f^{-1}(V)\text{ is open in } X$$
In other words, iff $f$ is continuous and open.

Then $Y$ has the finest topology such that $f$ is continuous, this topology is called the **quotient topology** on $Y$.
