* Definition
Let \(X\) be a [[id:C0ADBA68-2416-4041-A4E8-E3F3778D9938][topological space]] and let \(\sim\) be an equivalence relation on \(X\). Define \(Y := X/\sim\) to be the set of equivalence classes.

The construction of \(Y\) defines a canonical surjection \(q: X\to Y: x \mapsto [x]\).
The *quotient space* under \(\sim\) is the set \(Y\) equipped with the *quotient topology* whose open sets are those subsets \(U\subset Y\) whose preimage \(q^{-1}(U)\) is open.

* Quotient map
Let \(X, Y\) be topological spaces. Then a function \(f: X \to Y\) is a *quotient map* if it is subjective and the following holds:
\[V\subset Y \text{ is open in } Y \iff f^{-1}(V)\text{ is open in } X\]
In other words, iff \(f\) is continuous and open.

Then \(Y\) has the finest topology such that \(f\) is continuous, i.e.Â the [[id:96D71126-FCC6-4570-85D5-3EFB52F3CB5F][final topology]] induced by the function \(f\). If this \(f\) is the map \(x\xmapsto{q} [x]\) then this is the quotient topology.
