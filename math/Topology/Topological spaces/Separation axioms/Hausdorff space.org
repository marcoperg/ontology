#+title: Hausdorff space

** Definition
Let \((X, \tau)\) be a [[id:C0ADBA68-2416-4041-A4E8-E3F3778D9938][topological space]]. \((X, \tau)\) is said to be an /Hausdorff space/ or \(T_2\) if for all points \(x, y\) there exist a neighborhood \(V\) of \(x\) and a neighborhood \(U\) of \(y\) such that \(U \cap V = \emptyset\). That is, if any two points of the space are separated by neighborhoods.

The condition for being a Hausdorff space are important to ensure the uniqueness of limits on the space.
