#+title: T1 space

Let \((X, \tau)\) be a [[id:C0ADBA68-2416-4041-A4E8-E3F3778D9938][topological space]]. \((X, \tau)\) is said to be a \(T_1\) if for all points \(x, y \in X\), \(y\) has a neighborhood not containing \(X\).

** Proposition
X is \(T_1\) iff singletons of points are closed.

** Exempli gratia
The finite complement topology over any set \(X\) is \(T_1\). Moreover,s not [[id:14F2DB4F-672A-42CD-B683-BE90B7E3F5C9][Hausdorff space]] if \(X\) is infinite.
