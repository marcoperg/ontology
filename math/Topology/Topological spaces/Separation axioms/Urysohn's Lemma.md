Let $X$ be a [[Topological spaces|topological space]]. $X$ is [[T4 and normal spaces|normal]] iff for any closed subsets $A, B$ of $X$, there exists a continuous map
$$f:X \to [0,1]$$
such that $f(A) = \{0\}$ and $f(B) = \{1\}$. We say that $A$ and $B$ can be separated by a continuous real-valued function.
