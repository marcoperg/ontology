Let $(X, \tau)$ be a [[Topological spaces|topological space]]. $(X, \tau)$ is said to be a $T_4$ if for all closed subsets $C_1, C_2 \subset X$ there are disjoint neighborhoods of $C_1$ and $C_2$.

A space that is $T_4$ and [[T1 space|T1]] is called **normal**. A normal space is always [[T3 space|regular][[T3 space|regular]].
