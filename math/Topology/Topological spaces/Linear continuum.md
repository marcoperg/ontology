## Definition

An ordered set $X$ is a **linear continuum** if the following conditions hold:
1. Any non-empty bounded subset of $X$ has a least upper bound.
2. For all $x,y \in X$ such that $x<y$ there exist $z\in X$ with $x<z<y$.

e.g. 
- $\mathbb{R}$ (yes)
- $\mathbb{Q}$ (no, Dedekind's cut proves 1) does not hold).
- $\mathbb{Z}$ (no)

## Theorem

If $X$ is a linear continuum, then $X$ is connected and, also, every interval and ray is connected under the order topology.

### Corollary
$\mathbb{R}$ is connected.
