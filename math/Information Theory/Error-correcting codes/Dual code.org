#+title: Dual code

The *dual code* of the [[file:Linear code.org][linear code]]
\[
C =\subset \mathbb{F}^n_q
\]
is the linear code defined by
\[
C^\perp = \{x \in \mathbb{F}^n_q \space|\space \langle x, c \rangle = 0, \quad \forall c \in C\}
\]
where \(\langle x, c\rangle\) is the scalar product.

The dimension of \(C\) and its duals always add up to the length \(n\):
\[
dim C + dim C^\perp = n
\]
