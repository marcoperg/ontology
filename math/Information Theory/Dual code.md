The **dual code** of the [[Linear  code|linear code]]
$$
C =\subset \mathbb{F}^n_q
$$
is the linear code defined by
$$
C^\perp = \{x \in \mathbb{F}^n_q \space|\space \langle x, c \rangle = 0, \quad \forall c \in C\}
$$
where $\langle x, c\rangle$ is the scalar product.

The dimension of $C$ and its duals always add up to the length $n$:
$$
dim C + dim C^\perp = n
$$
