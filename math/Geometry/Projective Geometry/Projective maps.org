Given two nontrivial vector spaces \(E\) and \(F\), any linear map \(f: E \to F\) induces a partial map \(\mathbf{P}(f): \mathbf{P}(E) \to \mathbf{P}(F)\) called a /#projective map/, such that if \(Ker f = \{u \in E | f(u)=0\}\) is the kernel of \(f\), then \(\mathbf{P}(f): (\mathbf{P}(E)-\mathbf{P}(Ker f) \to \mathbf{P}(F))\) is a total map defined such that the following diagram commutes:

\[
\begin{CD}
E - Ker f @>f>> F - \{0\} \\
        @VVpV  @VVpV \\
\mathbf{P}(E)-\mathbf{P}(Ker f) @>\mathbf{P}(F)>> \mathbf{P}(F)
\end{CD}
\]

With \(p\) being the /canonical projection/ onto the [[id:9543A33A-0CDB-4476-87ED-87F81C2C1AE5][projective space]] induced by \(E\).

If \(f\) is injective, i.e. when \(Ker f = \{0\}\), then \(\mathbf{P}(E) \to \mathbf{P}(F)\) is a total function called a projective transformation, and when \(f\) is bijective, we call \(\mathbf{P}(f)\) a /projectivity/.

The set of /projectivities/ \(\mathbf{P}(f): \mathbf{P}(E) \to \mathbf{P}(E)\) is a group called /projective group/ and is denoted \(\mathbf{PGL}(E)\).

*Lemma:* Given two non trivial vector spaces \(E\) and \(F\) of the same dimension \(n+1\) associated with the projective frame \((a_i)_{i\leq i \leq n+2}\) for \(\mathbf{P}(E)\) and \((b_i)_{i\leq i \leq n+2}\) for \(\mathbf{P}(F)\), there is a unique projectivity \(h: \mathbf{P}(E) \to \mathbf{P}(F)\) such that \(h(a_i) = b_i\) for \(1 \leq i \leq n+2\).
