#+title: Projective subspaces

*Definition:* Given a nontrivial vector space \(E\), a /projective subspace/ of \(\mathbf{P}(E)\) is any subset \(W\) of \(\mathbf{P}(E)\) such that there is some subspace \(V \neq \{0\}\) of \(E\) with \(W = p(V - \{0\})\) . Where \(p\) is the [[id:9543A33A-0CDB-4476-87ED-87F81C2C1AE5][canonical projection]] onto the projective space of \(E\)

We say that a family \((a_i)_{i\in I}\) of points of \(\mathbf{P}(E)\) such that \(a_i = p(u_i)\) for every \(i\in I\).
