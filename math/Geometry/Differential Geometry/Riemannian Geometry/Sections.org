Let \(M\) be a [[id:58660F1E-EB64-4506-81E9-63FF79BD2E76][manifold]] and \(\pi: E \to M\) be a [[id:A5FA66EF-5DD4-4738-8545-29C5622498B8][vector bundle]] over \(M\). A *section* of \(E\) is map \(s: M\to E\) such that \(\pi \circ s = \text{Id}_M\), i.e.Â \(s(p) \in E_p\) for all \(p\in M\).

The set of smooth sections of a vector bundle is an infinite-dimensional vector space under pointwise addition and multiplication by constants, whose zero element is the zero section \(\zeta\) defined by \(\zeta_p =0 \in E_p\) for all \(p \in M\). This set is sometimes denoted \(\Gamma(E)\).
