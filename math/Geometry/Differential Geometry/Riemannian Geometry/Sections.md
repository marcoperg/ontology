Let $M$ be a [[Manifolds|manifold]] and $\pi: E \to M$ be a [[Vector Bundles|vector bundle]] over $M$. A **section** of $E$ is map $s: M\to E$ such that $\pi \circ s = \text{Id}_M$, i.e. $s(p) \in E_p$ for all $p\in M$. 

The set of smooth sections of a vector bundle is an infinite-dimensional vector space under pointwise addition and multiplication by constants, whose zero element is the zero section $\zeta$ defined by $\zeta_p =0 \in E_p$ for all $p \in M$. This set is sometimes denoted $\Gamma(E)$.
