Let $M$ be a [[Manifolds|smooth manifold]]. We define the **bundle of mixed $(k,l)$-tensors on $M$ by**
$$T^{(k,l)}T^*M = \coprod_{p\in M}T^{(k,l)}T^*_p M.$$
Since tensor spaces are also vector spaces, these bundles are all [[Vector Bundles|vector bundles]]. Which enables us to define **tensor fields** over a manifold by letting any [[Sections|section]] of this bundle be a tensor field.
