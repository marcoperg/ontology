#+title: Affine Space

An *affine space* is a triplet \(\langle A, \vec A, +\rangle\) consisting of a nonempty set of \(A\) (whose elements are called /points/), a [[id:C31DD475-75D9-4BB9-9DD5-536453386F9D][vector space]] space \(\vec A\) (of /translations/, or /free vectors/), and an action \(+: A \times \vec A\to A\), satisfying 1. \(a+0 = a\), for every \(a \in A\), where \(0\) is the identity element of \(\vec A\). 2. \((a+u)+v=a+(u+v)\), for every \(a\in A\), and every \(u,v\in \vec A\). 3. For any two points \(a, b \in A\) there is a unique \(u\in \vec A\) such that \(a + u = b\).

The first two axioms are equivalent to saying that \(+\) is [[id:CC585679-19D3-4EDF-A9A4-87D9387BF49D][Group Action]] of \(\vec A\) over \(A\).

The unique vector \(u \in \vec A\) such that \(a+u=b\) is denoted by \(\overrightarrow{ab}\). Thus, we also may write
\[
b = a + \overrightarrow{ab}
\]
â€‹## Affine map

Given two affine spaces \(A\) and \(B\) whose associated vector spaces are \(\vec A\) and \(\vec B\), an affine map from \(A\) to \(B\) is a map

\[
f: A \to B
\]
such that
\[
\begin{align}
\vec f: \vec A & \to\vec B \\
b - a & \mapsto f(b) - f(a)
\end{align}
\]
is a well-defined linear map. By well-defined is meant that if \(b - a = d - c\) implies that \(f(b) - f(a) = f(d) - f(c)\).

This implies that, for a point \(a \in A\) and a vector \(v \in \vec A\), one has
\[
f(a + v) = f(a) + \vec f(v)
\]

*** Alternative definition
Given two affine spaces \(A\) and \(B\), over the same field, a function \(f: A\to B\) is an affine map iff for every family \(((a_i, \lambda_i)_{i\in I}\) of weighted points in \(A\) such that \(\sum_{i\in I}\lambda_i = 1\), we have
\[
f(\sum_{i\in I}\lambda_ia_i) = \sum_{i\in I}\lambda_if(a_i)
\]
In other words, \(f\) preserves barycenters.
