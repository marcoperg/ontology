Given an arbitrary set $X$, and let $\mathcal{P}(X)$ be its power set. Then a subset $\Sigma \subset \mathcal{P}(X)$ is called a $\sigma$-algebra if and only if it satisfy the following:
1. $X$ is in $\Sigma$
2. $\Sigma$ is closed under complementation: If $A \in \Sigma$, then $X \backslash A \in \Sigma$.
3. $\Sigma$ is closed under unions: If $A_1, \dots, A_n \in \Sigma$, then $A_1 \cup\dots\cup A_n \in \Sigma$.

From these properties, it follows that the σ-algebra is also closed under countable intersections.

An interesting property is that the intersection of a collection of σ-algebras is also a σ-algebra.

## σ-algebra generated by an arbitrary family

Let $F$ be a family of subsets of $X$. Then there exists a unique smallest σ-algebra which contains every set in $F$. It is, in fact, the intersection of all σ-algebras containing $F$.

### Borel σ-sigma algebra
An important example is the [[Borel Sets|Borel algebra]] over any [[Topological spaces|topological space]]: the σ-algebra generated by the open sets.
