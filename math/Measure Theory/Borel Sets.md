Let $X$ be a [[Topological spaces|topological space]]. The Borel sets of $X$, something denoted $\mathcal{B}(X)$, are formed from open sets, through the operations of countable union, countable intersection and relative complement.

For a topological space $X$, the collection of all Borel sets on $X$ forms a [[σ-algebra]], known as the *Borel algebra* or *Borel σ-algebra*.
