#+title: Borel Sets

Let \(X\) be a [[id:C0ADBA68-2416-4041-A4E8-E3F3778D9938][topological space]]. The Borel sets of \(X\), something denoted \(\mathcal{B}(X)\), are formed from open sets, through the operations of countable union, countable intersection and relative complement.

For a topological space \(X\), the collection of all Borel sets on \(X\) forms a [[id:B697717A-34E5-4661-8B33-1AE2690CF8EA][σ-algebra]], known as the /Borel algebra/ or /Borel σ-algebra/.

The Borel algebra on /X/ is the smallest σ-algebra containing all open sets (or, equivalently, all closed sets).
