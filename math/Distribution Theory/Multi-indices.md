A muti-index of size $n$ is an n-tuple of natural numbers, that is, a member of $\mathbb{N}^n$. The length of a multi-index $\alpha = (\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \dots, \alpha_n)$ is defined as $\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \dots + \alpha_n$ and denoted $|\alpha|$.

Multi-indices are useful in multivariable calculus, in particular, the following notations are used:

$$
x^\alpha = x_1^{\alpha_1}\dots x_n^{\alpha_n}
$$
$$
\partial^\alpha = \frac{\partial^{|\alpha|}}{\partial x_1^{\alpha_1}\dots \partial x_n^{\alpha_n}}
$$
