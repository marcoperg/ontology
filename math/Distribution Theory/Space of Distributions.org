#+title: Space of Distributions

The space of distributions is the space of continuous linear [[id:14907899-E46A-4820-AC6E-61F144CD22AE][functionals]] \(T: \mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^n)\to \mathbb{R\text{ (or } \mathbb{C}\text{)}}\) of the [[id:41EF0CA7-2ACA-494F-AF1E-242AF2579860][space of Test Functions]].

** Notable Examples
*** Continuous functions:
For any \(f\in C(\mathbb{R}^n)\) we can define:
$$
\begin{align}
T_f:  & \mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^n) \to \mathbb{R} \\
 & T_f(\phi) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} f(x)\phi(x)\,dx

\end{align}
$$
which is a distribution. Hence, we can identify all continuous functions as a distribution. This works for all locally integrable functions as well. All distributions that can be defined in such a way are called *regular*.

*** Dirac delta-function
Which is defined as:
\[
\begin{align}
\delta :  & \mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^n) \to \mathbb{R} \\
 & \delta(\phi) = \phi(0)
\end{align}
\]
