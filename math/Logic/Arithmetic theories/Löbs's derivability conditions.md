For any extension $T$ of [[Robinson arithmetic]] where induction is defined over all $\Sigma_1$ ([[Arithmetical hierarchy| arithmetical hierarchy]] we have
1. If $T\vdash A$ then $Q\vdash \text{Prov}_T(A)$.
2. $T \vdash \text{Prov}_T(A\to B)\land \text{Prov}_T(A) \to \text{Prov}_T(B)$.
3. $T\vdash \text{Prov}_T(A) \to \text{Prov}_T(\text{Prov}_T(A))$

Where $\text{Prov}_T$ is the provability formula as introduced by GÃ¶del
This metatheorem draws a connection with modal logic given the possibility to construct the so call provability logic. Which is a $K4$ modal logic with extra theorems.
