## Definition
A _substitution_ is a total mapping $\sigma: V \to T$  from the set of variables $V$ to the set of terms $T$ of the language. The notation $\sigma = \{x_1\mapsto t_1, \dots x_k \mapsto t_k\}$, or alternatively $\{x_1/ t_1, \dots x_k / t_k\}$, refers to a substitution mapping each variable $x_i$ to the corresponding term $t_i$, for $i = 1, \dots, k$, and every other variable to itself.
