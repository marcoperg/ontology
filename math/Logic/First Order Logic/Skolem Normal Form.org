#+title: Skolem Normal Form

** Prenex normal form
A formula of the predicate calculus is said to be in *prenex normal form (PNF)* if it is written as a string of quantifiers and bound variables, called the prefix, followed by a quantifier-free part, called the matrix.

** Skolem Normal Form
A formula is said to be in *Skolem Normal Form (SNF)* if it is in prenex normal form with just universal first-order qunatifiers.

** Skolemization
The process of turning a wff to its Skolem Normal Form preserves the satisfiability, but no all the models, i.e.Â the result is not semantically equivalent.

This is enough for some use cases by means of the Validity, Completeness and Deduction Theorems:
\[
\{A_1, \dots, A_n\}\models B \quad\text{iff}\quad T[A_1, \dots, A_n] \vdash B\quad\text{iff}\quad \text{UNSAT}(A_1 \land\dots\land A_n \land \lnot B)
\]

The process of Skoleminaztion consists of four steps: 1. Move all quantifiers to the header of the formula (prenex form). 2. Eliminate free occurrences of variables (by means of existencia closure). 3. Make the /matrix/ of the formula into /conjunctive normal form/ (a conjunction of disjunctions of literals). 4. Remove existential quantifiers (by introducing Skolem functions).
