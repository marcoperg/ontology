** Definition
A [[id:571323C9-F216-4B72-9128-FBB8267F15B3][substitution]] \(\alpha\) is a /unifier/ of two atoms \(A\) and \(B\) if \(A\alpha = B \alpha\).

If such \(\alpha\) exists, \(A\) and \(B\) are said to be /unifiable/. Moreover, a unifier \(\alpha\) of \(A\) and \(B\) is called the /most general unifier (MGU)/ iff for any other unifier \(\beta\) of \(A\) and \(B\) there exists \(\gamma\) such that \(\beta = \alpha\gamma\).

** MGU Algorithm
\(\alpha = \lambda\)
*while* (\(A\alpha \neq B\alpha\)) 1. find the leftmost symbol in \(A\alpha\) such that the corresponding symbol in \(B\alpha\) is different 2. let \(t_A\) and \(t_B\) be the terms in \(A\alpha\) and \(B\alpha\) which begin with such symbols:
*if* (neither \(t_A\) nor \(t_B\) are variables) or
(one is a variable which occurs in the other one)
*then* *FAIL*: A and B are not unifiable\\
*else if* (\(t_A\) is a variable) *then* \(\alpha = \alpha(\{t_A/t_B\})\)
*else* \(\alpha = \alpha(\{t_B/t_A\})\)
\(\alpha\) is the MGU of \(A\) and \(B\).
