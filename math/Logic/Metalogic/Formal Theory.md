In math and logic a Formal Theory is a set of sentences in a formal language. Usually a formal theory $\mathcal{T}$ is formed by selecting a subset $\Sigma$ of sentences from the formal language which we called the axioms and adding every sentence that can be derived by applying a some deduction rules to sentences from $\Sigma$.
