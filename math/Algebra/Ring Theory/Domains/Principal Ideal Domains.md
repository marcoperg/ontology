# Definition

A [[Rings|ring]] $R$ is said to be a Principal Ideal Domain (PID) if all its [[Ideals and Quotient Rings|ideals]] are principal.

All [[Euclidean Domains|Euclidean domain]] are PIDs.

# Propositions

- All irreducible elements $a\in R^*$ of a PID $R$ generates maximal ideals. Which implies that all irreducible elements are prime.
- For every $x,y\in R$ there exist $\text{mcd}(x,y)$ and $\text{mcm}(x,y)$.
- Bezout's Identity always holds

Hence, for all $x\in A^* \backslash U(A)$ there are irreducible elements $a_1, \dots, a_n$ (pairwise prime), integers $\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_2$, and $u \in U(A)$ s.t.
$$x = u a_1^{\alpha_1}a_2^{\alpha_2}\dots a_n^{\alpha_n}$$
$a_1, \dots, a_n$ and $\alpha_1\dots \alpha_n$ are unique up to product by units of $A$.
