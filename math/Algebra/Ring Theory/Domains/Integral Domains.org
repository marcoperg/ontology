** Zero-Divisors
*** Definition
A /zero-divisor/ is a nonzero element \(a\) of a [[id:3CC31C84-CF5C-4C2C-90A6-623847BFF49F][commutative ring]] \(R\) such that

\[\exists b\in R: b\neq 0 \land ab = 0\]

** Integral Domain
*** Definition
An /integral domain/ is a commutative ring with unity and no zero-divisors.

** Cancellation Theorem
Let \(a, b\) and \(c\) belong to an integral domain. If \(a \neq 0\) and \(ab = ac\), then \(b = c\).

** Fields
*** Finite Equivalence Theorem
A finite integral domain is a [[id:0A6751A9-127F-40CA-BD65-2F69B68F0DD8][field]].

*** Corollary
For every prime \(p\), \(\mathbb{Z}_p\), the ring of integers modulo p, is a field.

** Characteristic of a Ring
*** Definition
The /characteristic/ of a ring \(R\) is the least positive integer \(n\) such that \(nx = 0\) for all \(x \in R\). If no such integer exists, we say that \(R\) has characteristic \(0\). The characteristic is denoted \(char R\).

*** Characteristic of a Ring with Unity
Let \(R\) be a ring with unity \(1\). If \(1\) has infinite order under addition, then the characteristic of \(R\) is \(0\). If \(1\) has order \(n\) under addition, then the characteristic of \(R\) is \(n\).

*** Characteristic of an Integral Domain
The characteristic of an integral domain is \(0\) or prime.

** Examples
All [[id:66B953C1-5B75-4CA7-A128-350A81DC11A5][unique factorization domains]] are, by definition, integral domains.
