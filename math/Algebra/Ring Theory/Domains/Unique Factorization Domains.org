--------------

aliases: - UFD - unique factorization domain

A [[id:3CC31C84-CF5C-4C2C-90A6-623847BFF49F][ring]] \(R\) is called a unique factorization domain (UFD) if it is an [[id:75C09067-1CB9-48D8-A1BF-C93A2960BE50][integral domain]] in which the following conditions are satisfied: 1. Every irreducible element is [[id:C2E40A22-5964-4868-B316-89D5D28D92DD][prime]]. 2. Every not null element that is not a unit is the product of irreducible elements.

An irreducible element \(p\) is a not unit, not null element of the ring for which \(p = ab\) for \(a,b \in R\) implies \(a\) or \(b\) unit. Every [[id:ED8C1E6C-C25A-4AEA-A484-6323522680DF][principal ideal domain]] is a UFD.
