** Definition
A ring /homomorphism/ \(\phi\) from a ring \(R\) to a ring \(S\) is a mapping from \(R\) to \(S\) that preserves the two ring operations; that is, for all \(a, b \in R\),
\[\phi(a + b) = \phi(a) + \phi(b) \quad \text{and} \quad \phi(ab) = \phi(a)\phi(b)\]
A ring homomorphisms that is both one-to-one and onto is called a ring /isomorphism/.

** Properties of Ring Homomorphism
Let \(\phi\) be a ring homomorphism from a ring \(R\) to a ring \(S\). Let \(A\) be a subring of \(R\) and let \(B\) be an ideal of \(S\). 1. For any \(r\in R\) and any positive integer \(n\), \(\phi(nr) = n\phi(r)\) and \(\phi(r^n) = \phi(r)^n\). 2. \(\phi(A) = \{\phi(a) | a\in A\}\) is a subring of \(S\). 3. If \(A\) is an ideal and \(\phi\) is onto \(S\), then \(\phi(A)\) is an ideal. 4. \(\phi^{-1}(B) = \{r \in R | \phi(r) \in B\}\) is an ideal of \(R\). 5. If \(R\) is commutative, then \(\phi(R)\) is commutative. 6. If \(R\) has a unity \(1\), \(S \neq \{0\}\), and \(\phi\) is onto, then \(\phi(1)\) is the unity of \(S\). 7. \(\phi\) is an isomorphism iff \(\phi\) is onto and \(Ker\space\phi = \{r\in R|\phi(r)=0\} = \{0\}\). 8. If \(\phi\) is an isomorphism from \(R\) onto \(S\), then \(\phi^{-1}\) is an isomorphism from \(S\) to \(R\).

** Kernels Are Ideals
Let \(\phi\) be a ring homomorphism from a ring \(R\) to a ring \(S\). Then \(Ker\space\phi\) is an ideal of \(R\).

** First Isomorphism Theorem For Rings
Let \(\phi\) be a ring homomorphism from \(R\) to \(S\). Then the mapping from \(R/Ker\space\phi\) to \(\phi(R)\), given by \(r + Ker\space\phi \mapsto \phi(r)\), is an isomorphism. In symbols, \(R/Ker\space\phi \cong \phi(R)\).

** Ideals Are Kernels
Every ideal of a ring \(R\) is the kernel of a ring homomorphism of \(R\). In particular, an ideal \(A\) is the kernel of the mapping \(r \mapsto r + A\) from \(R\) to \(R/A\).

** Field of Quotients
Let \(D\) be an integral domain. Then there exists a field \(F\) (called the field of quotients of \(D\)) that contains a subring isomorphic to \(D\).

*** Construction
The construction of this field starting on \(D\) mimics the construction of the field \(\mathbb{Q}\) of rationals numbers starting from the integers \(\mathbb{Z}\). 1. Let \(S=\{(a, b) |\space a,b \in D, b \neq 0\}\). 2. Define the equivalence relation on \(S\) such that \((a, b) \sim (c, d) \quad iff\quad ad=bc\). 3. Let \(F\) the set of equivalence classes \(F = \{[(a, b)]_{\sim}\space|\space a,b\in D\}\). And denote \((x, y)\) by \(x/y\). 4. We define addition and multiplication on \(F\) by
\[a/b + c/d = (ad+bc)/(bd)\quad\text{and}\quad a/b \cdot c/d = (ac)/(bd)\]
