## Definition
A subring $A$ of a a ring $R$ is called an _ideal_ of $R$ if for every $r \in R$ and every $a \in A$ both $ra$ and $ar$ are in $A$.

### Test
A nonempty subset $A$ of a ring $R$ is an ideal of $R$ if
1. $\forall a,b \in A: a - b\in A$ .
2. $\forall a\in A, r\in R: ar, ra \in A$.


## Quotient Rings

Let $R$ be a ring and let $I$ be an ideal of $R$. The set $\{r + I\space|\space\in A\}$ is a ring under the operations:
1. $(s+I) + (t+I) = (s+t) + I$.
2. $(s+I)(t+I) = st + I$.


## Prime Ideals and Maximal Ideals
### Prime Ideals
A _prime ideal_ $I$ of a commutative ring $R$ is a proper ideal of $R$ such that $a, b \in R$ and $ab\in R$ imply $a \in I$ or $b\in I$.
### Maximal Ideals
A _maximal ideal_ $A$ of a commutative ring $R$ is a proper ideal of $R$ such that, whenever $B$ is an ideal of $R$ and $A \subseteq B \subseteq R$, then $B = A$ or $B = R$.

### $R/I$ Integral Domain
Let $R$ be a commutative ring with unity and let $I$ be an ideal of $R$. Then $R/I$ is an integral domain iff $I$ is prime.

### $R/I$ Field

Let $R$ be a commutative ring with unity and let $I$ be an ideal of $R$. Then $R/I$ is a field iff $I$ is maximal.


## Generated Ideals

Given a set $L\subset A$, without algebraic structure, the ideal generated by $L$ is the smallest possible ideal of $A$ containing $L$. That is, if $\mathscr{L}$ is the collection of all ideals $J\subset A$ such that $J \supset L$ then, the ideal generated $L$ is
$$
I = \bigcap_{J\in \mathscr{L}} J
$$Also, $I$ is the set of all finite sums of the form
$$
\begin{align}
a_1x_1 + \dots + a_rx_r, && a_1,\dots,a_r, \in L && r\ge 1.
\end{align}
$$

An ideal $I$ is called finitely generated if it is generated by a finite set $L$, and denoted $I=(a_1,\ \dots, a_r)$ where $a_1, \dots, a_r$ are the elements of $L$. Moreover, if $I$ is generated by a single element is called a *principal ideal*.
