The [[Group Homomorphism|endomorphisms]] of an [[Groups|abelian group]] $X$ forms a [[Rings|ring]]. This ring is called the **endomorphism ring** of $X$, and denoted $End(X)$, i.e. the set of all [[Ring Homomorphism|homomorphism]] of $X$ to itself. Addition of endomorphism aries naturally in a pointwise manner and multiplication via endomorphism composition.

In this way the endomorphisms of an abelian group forms a (unital) ring, with the zero map $0: x \mapsto 0$ as additive identity and the identity map $1: x \mapsto x$ as multiplicative identity.

## Description
Let $(A, +)$ be an Abelian Group, consider the set $End(A)$ of group homomorphisms from $A$ to $A$.

Define addition as follows
given $f, g \in End(A)$ define $f + g: x \mapsto f(x) + g(x)$.
Under this operations $End(A)$ is an Abelian Group.

With the additional operation of composition of homomorphisms, $End(A)$ is a ring with multiplicative identity. This composition is explicitly $fg : x \mapsto f(g(x))$. The multiplicative identity is the identity homomorphism on $A$.
