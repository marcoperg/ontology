An _algebra over a [[Fields|field]]_ is a [[Vector spaces|vector space]] equipped with a bilinear product. Thus, an algebra is an algebraic structure consisting of a set together with operations of multiplication and addition and scalar multiplication by elements of a field and satisfying the axioms implied by "vector space" and "bilinear".
## Definition
Let $K$ be a [[Fields|field]], and let $A$ be a [[Vector spaces|vector space]] over $K$ equipped with an additional binary operation from $A\times A$ to $A$, denoted here by $\cdot$ . Then $A$ is an _algebra over $K$_ if the following identities hold for all elements $x, y, z \in A$, and all elements $a, b \in K$:
- **Right distributivity**: $(x + y) \cdot z= x\cdot z + y\cdot z$
- **Left distributivity:** $z \cdot (x+y) = z\cdot x + z\cdot y$
- **Compatibility with scalars**: $(ax) \cdot (by) = (ab)(x\cdot y)$
These three axioms defined the operations of multiplications as bilinear.
