A *module* is a generalization of the notion of vector space in which the [[id:0A6751A9-127F-40CA-BD65-2F69B68F0DD8][field]] of scalars is replaced by a [[id:3CC31C84-CF5C-4C2C-90A6-623847BFF49F][ring]]. The concept of a /module/ also generalizes the notion of [[id:48FAF6F8-DD4A-49F5-89B1-DCE13AE4A2F7][abelian group]], since the abelian groups are exactly the modules over the ring of integres.

** Definition
Suppose thar \(R\) is a [[id:3CC31C84-CF5C-4C2C-90A6-623847BFF49F][ring]], and \(1\) is its multiplicative identity. A *left \(R\)-module* \(M\) consists of an abelian group \((M, +)\) and an operation \(\cdot: R\times M \to M\) such that for all \(r, s \in R\) and \(x, y \in M\), we have

1. \(r\cdot (x + y) = r\cdot x + r\cdot y\)
2. \((r+s) \cdot x = r\cdot x + s\cdot x\)
3. \((rs) \cdot x = r\cdot (s\cdot x)\)
4. \(1\cdot x=x\)

The operation \(\cdot\) is called /scalar multiplication/. One may write \(_R{M}\) to emphasise that \(M\) is a left \(R\)-module. A right \(R\)-module \(M_R\) is defined similarly in terms of an operation \(\cdot: M\times R \to M\).
