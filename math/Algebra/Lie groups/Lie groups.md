A **real Lie group** is a [[Groups|group]] that is also a finite-dimensional [[Manifolds|smooth manifold]], in which multiplication and inversion are smooth maps.

Moreover, smoothness of multiplication
$$\mu: G\times G \to G\quad \mu(x, y)=xy$$
means that $\mu$ is a smooth mapping of the product manifold $G\times G$ into $G$.
