Let $(A, \le)$, $(B, \le)$ be two [[Partially ordered set|partially ordered sets]]. A **monotone Galois connection** between these [[Partially ordered set|posets]] consists on two monotone functions, $F: A \to B$ and $G: B\to A$, such that for all $a$ in $A$ and $b$ in $B$, we have
$$F(a) \le b \iff a \le G(b)$$
