#+title: Solvable group

aliases: - solvable

* Definition
A [[id:48FAF6F8-DD4A-49F5-89B1-DCE13AE4A2F7][group]] \(G\) is *solvable* if there exists a chain of subgroups
\[ G = G_0 \subset G_1 \subset \cdots \subset G_n = \{1\}.\]
such that, for all \(i\), \(G_{i+1}\) is a normal subgroup of \(G_i\) and \(G_i / G_{i+1}\) is abelian.

* Algorithm
Let \(G\) be a group, \(a,b\in G\). The *commutator* of \(a,b\) is \([a,b] = a^{-1}b^{-1}ab\). Notice \([a,b]=1 \iff ab=ba\).
The *commutator subgroup* \(G'\) of \(G\) is the subgroup generated by all \(\left\{[a,b] \,|\, a,b \in G\right\}\). We have \(G \text{ abelian} \iff G' = 1\).

*** Lemma 1
1. \(G'\) is a normal subgroup of \(G\).
2. \(G/G'\) is an abelian
3. If \(H\) is a normal subgroup of \(G\) such that \(G/H\) is abelian, then \(H \subset G'\).

*** Definition
We define higher order commutator subgroups via \(G^{(0)} := G\), \(G^{(1)}:= G'\), and, inductively, \(G^{(n+1)} = \left(G^{(n)}\right)'\).
â€‹### Lemma 2
\(G\) is solvable if and only if there exists an \(n\geq 0\) such that \(G^{(n)} = \{1\}\).

*** Corollary
Let \(G\) be a solvable group and \(\phi:G \to H\) be a surjective group homomorphism. Then \(H\) is solvable.
