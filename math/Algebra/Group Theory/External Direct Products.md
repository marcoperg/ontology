Let $G_1, G_2, ..., G_n$ be a finte collection of [[groups]]. The _external direct product_ of $G_1, G_2, .. G_n$, is 

$$
G_1 \oplus G_2, \oplus...\oplus G_n = \{(g_1, g_2, ..., g_n) | g_i \in G_i\}
$$

## Order
The order of an element in a direct product of a finite number of finite groups is the least common multiple of the orders of the components of the element:
$$
|(g_1, ...,g_n)| = lcm(|g_1|, ..., |g_n|)
$$

## Criterion for being cycle
Let $G$ and $H$ be finite cyclic groups. Then $G \oplus H$ is cyclic iff $|G|$ and $|H|$ are relatively prime.

## Criterion for $Z_{n_1, ..., z_k} \cong  Z_n \oplus... \oplus Z_n$  
Let $m = n_1 n_2 ... n_k$. Then $Z_m$ is isomorphic to $Z_{n_1} \oplus Z_{n_2} \oplus ... \oplus Z_{n_k}$ iff $n_i$ and $n_j$ are relatively prime when $i \neq j$.

## Group of Units Modulo $n$
Suppose $s$ and $t$ are relatively prime. Then 
$$U(st) \cong U(s) \oplus U(t)$$
