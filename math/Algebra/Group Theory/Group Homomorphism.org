aliases: - homomorphism - endomorphism

*Definition* A /homomorphism/ \(\phi\) from a group \(G\) to a [[id:48FAF6F8-DD4A-49F5-89B1-DCE13AE4A2F7][group]] \(H\) is a mapping from \(G\) into \(H\) that preserves the group operation. That is \(\phi(ab) = \phi(a)\phi(b)\) for all \(a, b \in G\).

The concept of homomorphism is a natural generalisation of the concept of [[id:9CEE2BBE-9DB7-4A0B-824C-512B3FEDF01B][isomorphism]].

** Kernel
*Definition* The /kernel/ of a homomorphism \(\phi\) from a group \(G\) to a group \(H\) with identity element \(e\) denoted \(Ker \phi\) is the set
\[
ker\phi = \{x \in G | \phi(x) = e\}
\]
â€‹## Properties of Homomorphism
Let \(\phi\) be a homomorphism from a group \(G\) to a group \(H\) and let \(g\in G\). Then

1. \(\phi(e_G) = e_H\), where \(e_G, e_H\) are the identity element of \(G\) and \(H\) respectivelty.
2. \(\phi(g^n) = (\phi(g))^n\), for all \(n \in \mathbb{Z}\).
3. If \(|g|\) is finite, then \(|\phi(g)|\) divides \(|g|\).
4. \(Ker \phi\) is a subgroup of \(G\).
5. \(\phi(a) = \phi(b)\) iff \(aKer\space\phi = bKer\space\phi\).
6. If \(\phi(g) = g'\), then \(\phi^{-1}(g') = \{x \in G | \phi(x)=g'\} = gKer\phi\).

** Properties of Subgroups Under Homomorphism
Let \(\phi\) be a homomorphism from a group \(G\) to a group \(\bar{G}\) and let \(H\) be a subgroup of \(G\). Then 1. \(\phi(H) = \{\phi(h) | h \in H\}\) is a subgroup of \(\bar{G}\). 2. If \(H\) is cyclic, then \(\phi(H)\) is cyclic. 3. If \(H\) is Abelian, then \(\phi(H)\) is Abelian. 4. If \(H\) is normal in \(G\), then \(\phi(H)\) is normal in \(\phi(G)\). 5. If \(|Ker\space\phi| = n\), then \(\phi\) is an \(n\)-to-\(1\) mapping from \(G\) onto \(\phi(G)\). 6. If \(|H| = n\), then \(|\phi(H)|\) divides \(n\). 7. If \(\bar{K}\) is a subgroup of \(\bar{G}\), then \(\phi^{-1}(\bar{K}) = \{k \in G\space|\space\phi(k) \in \bar{K}\}\) is a subgroup of \(G\). 8. If \(\bar{K}\) is a normal subgroup of \(\bar{G}\), then \(\phi^{-1}(\bar{K}) = \{k \in G\space|\space\phi(k) \in \bar{K}\}\) is a normal subgroup of \(G\). 9. If \(\phi\) is onto and \(Ker\space\phi = \{e\}\), then \(\phi\) is an isomorphism from \(G\) to \(\bar{G}\).

*** Corollary: Kernel Are Normal
Let \(\phi\) be a group homomorphism from \(G\) to \(H\). Then \(Ker\space\phi\) is a normal subgroup of \(G\).

** The First Isomorphism Theorem
*Theorem* Let \(\phi\) be a group homomorphism from \(G\) to \(H\). Then the mapping
\[\psi:G/ker\space\phi \to \phi(G): gKer\space\phi \mapsto \phi(G)\]
is an isomorphism. In other word \(G/Ker\space\phi \cong \phi(G)\).

Let \(\gamma:G \to G/Ker\space\phi: g \mapsto gKer\space\phi\) , then the theorem can be view as the following commutative diagrame:

#+begin_src tikz
\usepackage{tikz-cd}
\begin{document}
\begin{tikzcd}
G \arrow[rr, "\phi"] \arrow[rd, "\gamma"'] &                                    & \phi(G) \\
                                           & G/Ker\space\phi \arrow[ru, "\psi"] &        
\end{tikzcd}
\end{document}
#+end_src

*** Corollary
If \(\phi\) is a homomorphism from a finite group \(G\) to a group \(H\), then \(|\phi(G)|\) divides \(|G|\) and \(|H|\).

** Normal subgroups are kernels
Every normal subgroup of a group \(G\) is the kernel of a homomorphism of \(G\). In particular, a normal subgroup \(N\) is the kernel of the mapping \(g \mapsto gN\) from \(G\) to \(G/N\).

** Endomorphisms
An homomorphism from a group \(G\) to itself is called an endomorphism. If an endomorphism that is also an isomorphism is called and [[id:9CEE2BBE-9DB7-4A0B-824C-512B3FEDF01B][automorphism]].
