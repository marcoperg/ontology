## Definiton

Let $G$ be a set. A _binary operation_ $\star:G\times G \to G$ on $G$ is a function that assigns each ordered pair of elements of $G$.

Let $G$ be a set together with a binary operation $\star: G \times G \to G$. For every element $a, b \in G$ denote $a \star b$ with $ab$. We say that G is a _group_ under this operation if the following properties are satisfy:
- _Associativity_. $(ab)c = a(bc)$ $\forall a, b, c \in G$
- _Identity_. There is an element $e$ (called the _identity_) in $G$ such that $ae = ea = a$ for all $a$ in $G$.
- _Inverses_. Foreach element $a$ in $G$, there is an element $b$ in $G$ (called _the inverse_ of $a$) such that $ab$ = $ba$ = $e$.
