# Definition

A [[Groups|group]] $G$ is **solvable** if there exists a chain of subgroups
$$ G = G_0 \subset G_1 \subset \cdots \subset G_n = \{1\}.$$
such that, for all $i$, $G_{i+1}$ is a normal subgroup of $G_i$ and $G_i / G_{i+1}$ is abelian.

# Algorithm

Let $G$ be a group, $a,b\in G$. The **commutator** of $a,b$ is $[a,b] = a^{-1}b^{-1}ab$. Notice $[a,b]=1 \iff ab=ba$.
The **commutator subgroup** $G'$ of $G$ is the subgroup generated by all $\left\{[a,b] \,|\, a,b \in G\right\}$. We have $G \text{ abelian} \iff G' = 1$.


### Lemma 1
1. $G'$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.
2. $G/G'$ is an abelian
3. If $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ such that $G/H$ is abelian, then $H \subset G'$.

### Definition

We define higher order commutator subgroups via $G^{(0)} := G$, $G^{(1)}:= G'$, and, inductively,  $G^{(n+1)} = \left(G^{(n)}\right)'$.
### Lemma 2
$G$ is solvable if and only if there exists an $n\geq 0$ such that $G^{(n)} = \{1\}$.

### Corollary

Let $G$ be a solvable group and $\phi:G \to H$ be a surjective group homomorphism. Then $H$ is solvable.
