# Definition

A [[Groups|group]] $G$ is **solvable** if there exists a chain of subgroups
$$ G = G_0 \subset G_1 \subset \cdots \subset G_n = \{1\}.$$
such that, for all $i$, $G_{i+1}$ is a normal subgroup of $G_i$ and $G_i / G_{i+1}$ is abelian.

# Algorithm

Let $G$ be a group, $a,b\in G$. The **commutator** of $a,b$ is $[a,b] = a^{-1}b^{-1}ab$. Notice $[a,b]=1 \iff ab=ba$.
The **commutator subgroup** $G'$ of $G$ is the subgroup generated by all $\left\{[a,b] \,|\, a,b \in G\right\}$. We have $G \text{ abelian} \iff G' = 1$.
