#+title: Algebraic dual space

Given any vector space \(V\) over a field \(F\), the *(algebraic) dual space* \(V^*\) is defined as the set of all linear maps \(\phi: V \to F\) . Since linear maps are vector space homomorphisms, the dual space may be denoted \(hom(V, F)\).

The dual space \(V^*\) itself becomes a vector space over \(F\) when equipped with an addition and scalar multiplication satisfying:

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}

(\phi + \psi)(x) &= \phi(x) \psi(x) \\
(a \phi)(x) &= a(\phi(x))
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$

for all \(\phi, \psi \in V^*\), and \(a \in F\).

Elements of the algebraic dual space \(V^*\) are sometimes called *covectors*.
