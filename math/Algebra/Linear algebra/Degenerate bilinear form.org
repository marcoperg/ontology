#+title: Degenerate bilinear form

--------------

aliases: - degenerate - non-degenerate
---

Let \(V\) be a [[id:C31DD475-75D9-4BB9-9DD5-536453386F9D][vector space]] over a field \(\mathbb{F}\). Then a bilinear form on \(V\), i.e.Â a bilinear map \(f:V\times V\to \mathbb{F}\), is said to be *degenerate* if the map from \(V\) to \(V^*\) given by \((v\mapsto (x\mapsto f(x,v)))\) is not an isomorphism. Otherwise, is said to be *non-degenerate*.

An equivalent definition for the finite dimensional case is that it has a non-trivial kernel: there exist some non-zero \(x\in V\) such that
\(f(x, y) = 0\) for all \(y\in V\).
