## Definition

A _field_ is a commutative [[Rings|ring]] with unity in which every nonzero element is a unit.


# Characteristic

The characteristic of a field is the smallest $n\in \mathbb{Z}$ with $n\cdot 1 = \underbrace{1 + \cdots + 1}_\text{n-times} =0$. If such an integer does not exist the field is said to be of characteristic zero. We denote it by $\text{char}(p)$.
