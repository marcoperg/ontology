Let $L$ be a line segment in Euclidean space.
Let the length of $L$ be $d$.
Let $L'$ be a line segment of length $d'$ constructed from $L$ using compass and straightedge.
Then:
$$d' = qd$$
where $q$ is an [[Algebraic independence|algebraic number]] whose degree (i.e. the degree of its [[Minimal polynomial|minimal polynomial]]) is a power of $2$.
