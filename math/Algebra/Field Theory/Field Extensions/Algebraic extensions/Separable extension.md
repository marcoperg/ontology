# Definition

An [[Algebraic independence|algebraic extension]] $L/k$ is **separable** if every irreducible polynomial in $k[x]$ with a root in $L$ does not have multiple roots in its [[Splitting fields|splitting field]].

Given $k$, if all algebraic extensions of $k$ are separable, $k$ is said to be **perfect**. All fields of characteristic $0$ are perfect.

## Primitive element theorem

Let $L/k$ be a finite separable extension. Then there exists an element $a\in L$ such that $L = k(a)$.
