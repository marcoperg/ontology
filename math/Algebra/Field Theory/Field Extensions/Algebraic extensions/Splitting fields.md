# Definition

Let $k$ be a [[Fields|field]], $f\in k[x]$ polynomial of degree $n$. A finite extension $L/k$ is called the **splitting field of** $f$ **over** $k$ if
1. $f$ splits over $L$ into linear factors.
2. $f$ does not split over any intermediate field into linear factors.

## Existence theorem

The following theorem motivates the fact that such a field always exists.

Let $f\in k[x]$ irreducible. Then there is a [[Algebraic independence|simple algebraic extension]] $L/k$ such that $f$ has a root in $L$. Moreover, $[L : k] = \partial f$.
