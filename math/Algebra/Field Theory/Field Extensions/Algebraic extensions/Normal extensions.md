# Definition

Let $L/k$ be an [[Algebraic independence|algebraic extension]]. Then, $L/k$ is called **normal** if every polynomial $f\in k[x]$ with a zero in $L$ splits over $L$ into linear factors.

## Theorem

A finite field extension $L/k$ is normal if and only if $L$ is the [[Splitting fields|splitting field]] of a polynomial $f \in k[x]$.
