Let $K, E$ be [[Fields|fields]]. It is said that $E$ is an extension of $K$ and denoted $E/K$ is there is a [[Ring Homomorphism|homomorphism]] $j: K \to E$. Since $K$ is a field, $j$ is necessarily surjective, and $K \cong(K)$.

$K/E$ has structure of [[Vector spaces|vector space]] over $K$. The *degree* of the extension, denoted $[E : K]$, is the dimension $dim_K E$ of $E$ as vector space over $K$.
