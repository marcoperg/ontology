If $E/K$ is a [[Field Extensions|field extension]] and $a_1, \dots, a_n$ elements of $E$. We have a homomorphism (of evaluation)
$$K\left[X_1, \dots, X_2 \right] \to E: f \mapsto f(a_1, \dots, a_n)$$
which kernel we denote by $I$.
1. It is said that $a_1, \dots, a_n$ are *algebraically independent over $K$* if $I = \{0\}$, this is $f(a_1, \dots, a_n) \neq 0$ for every not null polynomial $f \in K[X_1\dots, X_n]$.
2. Otherwise they are called *algebraically dependent*.

For $n=1$ if $a_1$ is algebraically independent over $K$ it is said that $a_1$ is *transcendental* over $K$. Otherwise, if $a_1$ is algebraically dependent, $a_1$ is called algebraic over $K$.

### Existence of transcendental numbers

From Cantor, we know that the set of real algebraic numbers over $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable, hence the set of transcendental numbers must be uncountable and much larger.
