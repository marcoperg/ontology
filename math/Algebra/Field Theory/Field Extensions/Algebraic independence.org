If \(E/K\) is a [[id:2F01C024-2ED3-4614-BC4B-DFCF4EC04C27][field extension]] and \(a_1, \dots, a_n\) elements of \(E\). We have a homomorphism (of evaluation)
\[K\left[X_1, \dots, X_2 \right] \to E: f \mapsto f(a_1, \dots, a_n)\]
which kernel we denote by \(I\). 1. It is said that \(a_1, \dots, a_n\) are /algebraically independent over \(K\)/ if \(I = \{0\}\), this is \(f(a_1, \dots, a_n) \neq 0\) for every not null polynomial \(f \in K[X_1\dots, X_n]\). 2. Otherwise they are called /algebraically dependent/.

For \(n=1\) if \(a_1\) is algebraically independent over \(K\) it is said that \(a_1\) is *transcendental* over \(K.\)Otherwise, if \(a_1\) is algebraically dependent, \(a_1\) is called *algebraic* over \(K\).

An extension \(K/k\) is called an *algebraic extension* if all elements
\(a\in K\) are algebraic over \(k\).

Moreover, Let \(k\) be a field, then \(k(a)/k\) is called a *simple algebraic extension*.

*** Existence of transcendental numbers
From Cantor, we know that the set of real algebraic numbers over \(\mathbb{Q}\) is countable, hence the set of transcendental numbers must be uncountable and much larger.
