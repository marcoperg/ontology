* Definition

Let $X$ be a [[id:29768ACE-BD6A-47E1-9E63-EAFAEDB474AA][Banach space]]. Then, a set $C\subseteq X$is said toe be *weak sequentially compact* if every sequence $(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ in $C$ has a [[id:DDA11B2B-893E-4AC3-AF11-E5135CBD766B][weakly convergence]] subsequence.


* Important theorem motivating the usefulness of the weak topology

Let $X$ be a Banach space. If $X$ is reflesive, i.e. $X^{**} \cong X$ where $X^{**}$ stands for the double continuous dual, then the unit closed ball is weak sequentially compact.
