#+title: Weak convergence
#+SETUPFILE: ../../setup.org

Let $X$ be a normed vector space. A sequence $(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ is said to weakly convergence to $x$, denoted $x_n\rightharpoonup x$ if

$$\forall l\in X^*: l(x_n) \rightarrow l(x)$$

Where $X^*$ denoted the continuous dual space.

* Relation with strong convergence

Strong convergence implies weak convergence. The converse is not true in general.
