$L^2$ is the [[Hilbert Spaces|Hilbert Space]] form by the square integrable functions, that is, functions  $f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{C}$ such that:
$$
\int_{-\infty}^\infty |f(x)|^2\,dx < \infty
$$

Where the inner product $\langle f,g\rangle$ for $f, g \in L^2$ is defined as
$$
\langle f, g \rangle = \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x)\overline{g(x)}dx
$$
For both definitions, one can consider limits $a, b$ for integration instead of $\infty, -\infty$.
