Let $P(x, y)$ and $Q(x, y)$ be continuous and have continuous partial derivatives in a region $\mathcal{R}$ and on its boundary $C$. _Green's Theorem_ states that
$$
\oint_C P\,dx + Q\,dy = \iint_\mathcal{R} \left(\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial P}{\partial y}\right)\,dx\,dy
$$
The theorem is valid both [[Simply and Multiply Connected Regions|simply and multiply connected regions]].
