A region $\mathcal{R}$ is called _simply connected_ if any simple closed curve, which lies in $\mathcal{R}$, can be shrunk to a point without leaving $\mathcal{R}$. A region $\mathcal{R}$, which is not simply connected is called _multiply-connected_.

Intuitively, a simply-connected region is one that does not have any "holes" in it, while a multiply-connected region is one that does.

Pending more rigorous definition.
