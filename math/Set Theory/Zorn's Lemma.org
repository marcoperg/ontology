#+title: Zorn's Lemma

If \(S\) is a nonempty [[file:file:partially ordered set.org][partially ordered set]] in which every chain (a set of pairwise comparable elements) has an upper bound, then \(S\) has a maximal element. This statement is equivalent to the [[Zermelo--Fraenkel Set Theory Axioms.org][axiom of choice]].
