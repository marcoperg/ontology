#+title: Ramsey numbers

The Ramsey number \(R(s, t)\) is the minimum number \(n\) such that any [[id:06F8A232-B4F7-424C-9F0B-098AC6CBEE6D][graph]] on \(n\) vertices contains either an independent set of size \(s\) or a clique of size \(t\).

The Ramsey number \(R_k(s_1, s_2, \dots , s_k)\) is the minimum number \(n\) such that any coloring of the edges of \(K_n\) with \(k\) colors contains a clique of size \(s_i\) in color \(i\), for some \(i\).

* Ramsey's theorem
For any \(s,t\ge 1\), there is \(R(s,t)<\infty\) such that any graph on \(R(s,t)\) vertices contains an independent set of size \(s\) or a clique of size \(t\). In particular
\[R(s,t) \le\binom{s+t-2}{s-1}.\]
