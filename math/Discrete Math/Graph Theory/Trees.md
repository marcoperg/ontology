## Definition
A [[Graphs|graph]] $G$ is said to be a **tree** if is a connected acyclic graph.

## Properties
- Between each pair of vertices exists a unique path.
- Every edge is an bridge.
- A tree of $n$ vertices has $n-1$ edges.
- Every non-trivial tree has at least two leaves.

## Characterization of a tree
A simple graph $G=(V, E)$ is a tree iff one of the following equivalent statements is true:
- Between each pair of vertex exists one unique path.
- $G$ is connected graph and every edge is a bridge
- $G$ is a maximal acyclic graph
- $G$ is connected and $|V|=|E| -1$.
- $G$ is acyclic and $|V|=|E| -1$.
