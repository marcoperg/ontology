Let \(C\) and \(D\) be [[id:6B755D9E-EB8E-4673-ADD0-B4411D410D52][categories]]. A *functor* \(F\) from \(C\) to \(D\) is a mapping that - associates each object \(X\) in \(\text{ob}(C)\) to an object \(F(X)\) in \(\text{ob}(D)\). - associates each morphism \(f: X\to Y\) in \(\text{C}\) to a morphism \(F(f): F(X) \to F(Y)\) in \(D\) such that the following two conditions hold: - \(F(\text{id}_X) = \text{id}_{F(X)}\) for every object \(X\) in \(C\), - \(F(g \circ f) = F(g) \circ F(f)\) for all morphisms \(f:X\to Y\) and \(g:Y\to Z\) in \(C\).

That is, functors must preserve identity morphisms and composition of morphisms.
