#+title: Symmetries

In the context of quantum mechanics, though it can be further generalised, symmetries are operators \(V\) that commute with the time evolution operator \(U\).

Let \(V\) be a unitary operator acting on the [[id:E5B1D38D-297B-4867-91DA-75156F747A92][Hilbert Space]] of state vectors, and \(U\) be the time evolution operator. So
\[
V |\psi\rangle = |\psi'\rangle, \quad U|\psi_1\rangle = |\psi_2\rangle
\]
And the following diagram commutes:

$$
\begin{CD}
|\psi_1\rangle @>U>> |\psi_2\rangle \\
@V\text{V}VVV @V\text{V}VV \\
|\psi_1'\rangle @>U>> |\psi_2'\rangle \\

\end{CD}
$$

The justification for such a definition can be found on the analysis of symmetries as thing that doesn't alter how things affect the state of a system.
