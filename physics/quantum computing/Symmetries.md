In the context of quantum mechanics, though it can be further generalised, symmetries are operators $V$ that commute with the time evolution operator $U$.

Let $V$ be a unitary operator acting on the [[Hilbert Spaces|Hilbert Space]] of state vectors, and $U$ be the time evolution operator. So
$$
V |\psi\rangle = |\psi'\rangle, \quad U|\psi_1\rangle = |\psi_2\rangle
$$
And the following diagram commutes:

$$
\begin{CD}
|\psi_1\rangle @>U>> |\psi_2\rangle \\
@V\text{V}VVV @V\text{V}VV \\
|\psi_1'\rangle @>U>> |\psi_2'\rangle \\

\end{CD}
$$

The justification for such a definition can be found on the analysis of symmetries as thing that doesn't alter how things affect the state of a system.
